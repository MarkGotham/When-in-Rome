WARNINGS =====================
WARNING: There are 41 measures in the score but 40 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The final chord in the analysis comes before the final measure, or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without an accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the HarmonicRanges will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
