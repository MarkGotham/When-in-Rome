    Find instances of modal mixture as defined in [forthcoming].

    At a minimum, this means the presence of
    at least one pitch that is potentially an instance of mixture:
    a tone that can be considered outside the host mode but within the parallel (German: Variant).

    Accounting for all minor forms, this means
    {m3, m6, m7} for mixture of minor into major, and
    {M3, M6, M7} for major into minor.

    Note the absence of m7 into minor:
    while this could be considered outside the host mode
    (depending on the minor mode in question),
    it cannot be considered a borrowing from the major.

    First an example of borrowing from the minor into major (m6).

    >>> flat_6 = roman.RomanNumeral("iv", "G")
    >>> is_mixture(flat_6)
    True

    Now a complementary example of borrowing from the major into the minor (M3).

    >>> picardy = roman.RomanNumeral("I", "c")
    >>> is_mixture(picardy)
    True

    Users may select True/False for each of several (following) criteria,
    avoiding certain pitches that strengthen/weaken the case for mixture specifically.
    (Remember that this is distinct from other types of chromaticism.)

    Chords make a stronger case for mixture by
    avoiding pitches that are unequivocally not mixed.
    In major this means {M3}; in minor it is {m3, m6}.
    Set `exclude_clear_non_mixture` to True to require this (default = False).

    >>> min_6_maj_3 = ["F", "Ab", "C", "E"]
    >>> min_6_maj_3 = roman.romanNumeralFromChord(chord.Chord(min_6_maj_3), "C")
    >>> is_mixture(min_6_maj_3)  #, exclude_clear_non_mixture=False)
    True

    >>> is_mixture(min_6_maj_3, exclude_clear_non_mixture=True)
    False

    The `require_shared_or_mixed` argument (default = False) provides a
    stronger version of this, which expands on the `exclude_clear_non_mixture`
    criteria to also exclude any pitches that are outside the combined modes
    (major or at least one of the parallel minor forms):
    i.e., not #1 / b2 or #4 / b5.
    If either excluded pitch is present, then this function returns False.

    >>> sharp_4_flat_3 = roman.RomanNumeral("viio7/V", "C")
    >>> is_mixture(sharp_4_flat_3, require_shared_or_mixed=False)
    True

    >>> is_mixture(sharp_4_flat_3, require_shared_or_mixed=True)
    False

    This helps make sense of the status of Neapolitan- and Augmented Sixth chords.
    Both can be considered in terms of modal mixture into major, due to the use of m6,
    but both also use chromatic pitches:
    b2 in the case of the Neapolitan, and
    (at least) #4 in the case of the Augmented Sixth chords.
    When `require_shared_or_mixed` is True, they return False; when False, then True.

    >>> aug_6 = roman.RomanNumeral("Ger65", "C")
    >>> is_mixture(aug_6, require_shared_or_mixed=True)
    False

    >>> is_mixture(aug_6, require_shared_or_mixed=False)
    True

    Avoiding {M6, m7, M7} makes the chord consistent across minor forms.
    In major, meeting this condition counts towards mixture, in minor it counts against.
    Set `require_fits_all_minor` = True to require this (default = False).

    >>> m3_M6 = chord.Chord("A C Eb")
    >>> m3_M6 = roman.romanNumeralFromChord(m3_M6, "C")
    >>> is_mixture(m3_M6, require_fits_all_minor=False)
    True

    >>> is_mixture(m3_M6, require_fits_all_minor=True)
    False

    Note that for (potential minor mixture into) major key contexts,
    `require_fits_all_minor` is more restrictive than `require_shared_or_mixed`
    so setting `require_fits_all_minor` to True and `require_shared_or_mixed` to False
    is contradictory and print a warning.

    This function can work either by comparing pitch classes
    (i.e. as numbers 0-11, ignoring spelling)
    or with full pitch spelling. See notes at `add_mixture_info()`.

    Finally, there is the question of how to handle applied (secondary) chords.
    Here, `secondary_against_home_key` is True by default, meaning that
    the pitches of the chord are considered against the primary ("home") key.
    Set `secondary_against_home_key` = False to override this and consider
    mixture against the secondary key.

    This is potentiatlly significant in dealing with numerals like
    "viio7/v".
    It is clear whether that chord is really "viio7/v" or "viio7/V" and analysts do not agree.
    Again, by using the deafult of comparing this chord against the primary tonality, that
    "viio7/v" or "viio7/V" are equivalent.

    >>> in_v = roman.RomanNumeral("viio7/v", "C")
    >>> in_V = roman.RomanNumeral("viio7/V", "C")

    Show they have different figures ...
    >>> in_v.figure == in_V.figure
    False

    ... but the same pitches:
    >>> [p.name for p in in_v.pitches] == [p.name for p in in_V.pitches]
    True

    Of "/v" (minor), first with `secondary_against_home_key` (so against the home key, i.e., "C"):

    >>> is_mixture(in_v)
    True

    Now with `secondary_against_home_key` as False, so with the key as "v" in "C" (i.e. "g").
    >>> is_mixture(in_v, secondary_against_home_key=False)
    False

    Now of "/V" (major), first against the home key (i.e., "C"), as above.

    >>> is_mixture(in_V)
    True

    And finally with `secondary_against_home_key` as False, so "V" in "C" (i.e. "G" major).
    >>> is_mixture(in_V, secondary_against_home_key=False)
    True

    We can assess how modally mixed each chord is in the abstract,
    looking only at the (single) chord in question
    (see `is_mixture()` and `add_mixture_info()`).
    However, for a more complete picture, we also need to look at the context.

    Even the single chord case considers the key-context.
    These tests demonstrate that "iv" is mixed in a major context, but not in minor one:

    >>> minor_subdominant_in_major = roman.RomanNumeral("iv", "C")
    >>> is_mixture(minor_subdominant_in_major)
    True

    >>> minor_subdominant_in_minor = roman.RomanNumeral("iv", "a")
    >>> is_mixture(minor_subdominant_in_minor)
    False

    This function assesses the relative mixture of a given chord (`rn`)
    against the context of the _proceeding_ and _following_ chords.
    That context is either provided explicitly
    (by the arguments `rn_before` and `rn_after`),
    or using the .previous() and .next() methods on a music21 Stream.

    The returned value estimates the strength of mixture
    according to the values provided by `is_mixture`, with a twist:
    while 'more is more' for the chord in question
    (stronger mixture on that chord indicates stronger mixture overall),
    the chords before and after can
    _enhance_ the case for mixture when they are clearly _not_ mixed (less is more).

    Currently, this is calculated by simple addition/substracion of the values:
    the central chord counts positively, while the surrounding chords count negatively.
    (The details of that calculation may change, but the basic logic is unlikely to).

    Let's return to the `minor_subdominant_in_major` case introduced above.
    
    Alone, it receives rather a low mixture score:
    
    >>> add_mixture_info(minor_subdominant_in_major).mixture_metric
    2

    Surrounded by a major tonic chord ("I"),
    the overall case for mixture is gratly enhanced:

    >>> major_tonic = roman.RomanNumeral("I", "C")
    >>> progression_mixture_metric(minor_subdominant_in_major, major_tonic, major_tonic)
    6

    Conversely, placing that same chord between _minor_ tonics ("i")
    reduces the case for mixture because the overall impression is on continued minor mode
    rather than a momentary borrowing:

    >>> minor_tonic = roman.RomanNumeral("i", "C")
    >>> progression_mixture_metric(minor_subdominant_in_major, minor_tonic, minor_tonic)
    -2

    The remaining parameter argument for this function handle special cases
    which may return the boolean False.

    If the `exclude_picardy` argument is True (default) then
    we exclude cases of the "Picardy third" whereby the last chord in a piece
    (i.e., there's no `next`) is a major tonic in a minor key context.
    If `exclude_completed_applied` is True (default) then
    exclude secondary and applied chords, but only if they resolve as implied.

    See tests at `is_picardy` and `is_completed_applied`.

    - neutral (shared by major and minor)
    - definitely indicative of mixture
    - potentially indicate of mixture
    - definitely indicative of non-mixture
    - chromatic (none of the above - neither diatonic nor mixture).

    .clear_mixture_count: int counting notes that definitely indicate mixture

    2

    .potential_mixture_count: int counting notes that only might indicate mixture.
    E.g., the minor seventh in major key is not in major,
    but can also only be considered mixture depending on the type of minor scale.
    >>> v_in_C = roman.RomanNumeral("v", "C")
    >>> v_in_C = add_mixture_info(v_in_C)

    1

    Note that this is separate from the .clear_mixture_count.
    >>> v_in_C.clear_mixture_count
    0

    .clear_non_mixture_count: int counting notes that certainly indicate non-mixture
    E.g., the major third in major key.

    >>> tonic_major = roman.RomanNumeral("I", "C")
    >>> tonic_major = add_mixture_info(tonic_major)
    >>> tonic_major.clear_non_mixture_count
    1
    
    .other_count: int counting instances of other notes
    that are neither diatonic nor mixture (none of the above).
    E.g., the diminished fifth.
    >>> rn_Gb = roman.RomanNumeral("io", "C")  # includes Gb
    >>> rn_Gb = add_mixture_info(rn_Gb)
    >>> rn_Gb.other_count
    1

    Note that this `other_count` can depend on whether `spelling_matters`.
    Iff spelling_matters then the flat 6th degee must be spelt as such (e.g., as Ab in C).
    If not, then enharmonics count too (i.e., G# in C).
    In comparing G# and Ab in C major, only G# adds to the other_count, and only if spelling_matters.
    
    >>> rn_Ab = roman.RomanNumeral("iio", "C")  # includes Ab
    >>> no_spelling = add_mixture_info(rn_Ab, spelling_matters = False)

    0

    0

    >>> raised_fifth = add_mixture_info(rn_G_sharp, spelling_matters = True)
    >>> raised_fifth.other_count
    1

    Several other boolean summative attributes derive from these counters:
    .all_harmonic: bool checking if all pitches are in the harmonic minor.
    >>> viio7 = roman.RomanNumeral("viio7", "C")  # includes B, Ab
    >>> viio7 = add_mixture_info(viio7)
    >>> viio7.all_harmonic
    True

    .all_natural:
    bool, likewise for natural minor.
    >>> v_in_C.all_natural  # As above. Includes Bb
    True

    .includes_chromatic:
    bool, true if there is at least 1 chromatic pitch (as defined above).
    >>> rn_Gb.includes_chromatic  # As above. Includes Gb
    True

    .all_shared_or_mixed:
    bool, as for "chromatic" with the additional consideration of "clearlyNotMixed".
    
    Finally, the `.mixture_metric` attribute (int) is also summative,
    providing an approximate strength value for a mixture (which can be negative).
    The result of the mixture_metric can be weighted with the following settable arguments
    which weight each relevant tone to the value given:
        clear_mixture_weight: int = 2
        potential_mixture_weight: int = 1
        other_weight: int = 1
    With these weights the maximum value per note is 2 and the minimium is -2.
    In princple then this number can be multiplied up for each tone.
    Even mixture chords rarely have more than 2 notes indicative of mixture,
    though it is possible, especially if we accept added tones.
    >>> maximix = roman.RomanNumeral("i[addb6][addb7]", "C")  # includes Eb, Ab, Bb
    >>> maximix = add_mixture_info(maximix)
    >>> maximix.mixture_metric
    5

    Note that this whole function works by transposing the pitches to C and
    comparing against C major or minor as appropriate.
    This is prefered over alternatives
    (like creating a new RN in C major / minor)
    so that specifications on the original object (like roman.Minor67Default)
    are reliably preserved.
    
    The spelling_matters argument determines whether to use pitch spelling or
    pitch classes as discussed above.

    the options with handling secondary Roman numerals with the
    .secondary_against_home_key argument.
