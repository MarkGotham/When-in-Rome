PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.45%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 2, beat 4.5, viio64 in g minor, indicating the pitches ['C', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['G3', 'C4', 'A4'], ['G3', 'C4', 'G4'], ['G3', 'C4', 'F#4']].
Match strength estimated at 58.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 13, beat 1.5, III+ in g minor, indicating the pitches ['B-', 'D', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['B-2', 'F#4', 'C5'], ['C3', 'F#4', 'C5'], ['D3', 'F#4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 58.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
