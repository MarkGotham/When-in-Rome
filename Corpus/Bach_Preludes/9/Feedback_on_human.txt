PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 7, vi7 in B major appears on beat 4.33.
Measure 7, vii in B major appears on beat 4.67.
Measure 8, viiob75/V in B major appears on beat 1.67.
Measure 21, vi7 in E major appears on beat 4.33.
Measure 21, vii in E major appears on beat 4.67.
Measure 22, viio7/v in E major appears on beat 1.67.
Measure 23, viio4b3 in E major appears on beat 4.67.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

The inversions look good: the bass note/s implied by the Roman numerals appear at least once in the lowest part during the relevant span.
