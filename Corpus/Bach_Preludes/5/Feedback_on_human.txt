PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 93.06%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 8, beat 1, V7b2/V in E major, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'A#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['F#2', 'A#4'], ['F#2', 'E4'], ['F#4'], ['G4'], ['F#3', 'C#4'], ['F#3', 'G4'], ['F#4'], ['E4']].

HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.
