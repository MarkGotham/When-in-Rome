PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.58%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 28, beat 1, #ivb3 in e- minor, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['C-6'], ['A5'], ['B-5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 96.67%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 13, beat 1, iv42 in b- minor, indicating the bass D- for lowest note(s) of: ['E-3'].
How about:
m13 b1 iv7


Measure 39, beat 1, viio65 in e- minor, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['E-3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
