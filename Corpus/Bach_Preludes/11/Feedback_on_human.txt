PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 18, V in F major appears on beat 2.67.
Measure 18, I6 in F major appears on beat 4.33.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

The inversions look good: the bass note/s implied by the Roman numerals appear at least once in the lowest part during the relevant span.
