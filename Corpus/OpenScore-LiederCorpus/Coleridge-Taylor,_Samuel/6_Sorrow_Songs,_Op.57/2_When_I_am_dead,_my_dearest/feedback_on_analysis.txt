PITCH COVERAGE =====================

Total cases: 2

Overall pitch match: 89.28%.

In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 17, beat 2, V7 in b, indicating the pitches ['F#5', 'A#5', 'C#6', 'E6'] accounting for successive chord "slices" of [['B1', 'B2', 'E4', 'F#4', 'B4', 'C#5']].
Pitch match: 50.0%
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 47, beat 2, V7 in b, indicating the pitches ['F#5', 'A#5', 'C#6', 'E6'] accounting for successive chord "slices" of [['D4', 'F#4', 'B4'], ['E4', 'F#4', 'B4', 'C#5']].
Pitch match: 57.14%
How about:
m47 b2 i6 for the pitches ['D4', 'F#4', 'B4']
