PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.69%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 43, beat 1, ii in C- major, indicating the pitches ['D-', 'F-', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [['D-3', 'G-3', 'A-3', 'F-4', 'G-4', 'G-5'], ['D-3', 'G-3', 'A-3', 'F-4', 'G-4', 'F-5'], ['D-3', 'G-3', 'A-3', 'F-4', 'G-4', 'E-5']].
Match strength estimated at 56.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.
