PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.29%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 54, beat 1, iio65 in b minor, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G', 'B-', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [['F#1', 'F#2', 'E3', 'G3', 'B3', 'C#4', 'C#5'], ['F#1', 'F#2', 'E3', 'G3', 'B3', 'C#4', 'D5'], ['F#1', 'F#2', 'E3', 'G3', 'B3', 'C#4', 'C#5']].
Match strength estimated at 55.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 98.41%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 54, beat 1, iio65 in b minor, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: ['F#1'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.



WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 63 measures in the score but 62 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The final chord in the analysis comes before the final measure, or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without an accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the HarmonicRanges will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
