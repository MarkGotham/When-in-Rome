PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.44%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 30, beat 2.5, viio6 in c minor, indicating the pitches ['D-', 'F-', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [['C2', 'C3', 'D3', 'B3', 'D4', 'B4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
