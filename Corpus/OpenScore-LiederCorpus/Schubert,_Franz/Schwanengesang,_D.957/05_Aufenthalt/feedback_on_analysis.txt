PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


RARE ROMAN NUMERALS =====================

Total cases: 10
The following Roman numerals are perfectly clear and the system has no trouble parsing them, though they are somewhat rare so may be worth reviewing:

Measure 13, beat 1: i54 in e minor.

Measure 21, beat 1: i54 in e minor.

Measure 29, beat 1: V7[no3] in e minor.

Measure 32, beat 1: V7[no3] in e minor.

Measure 33, beat 1: V9[no3] in e minor.

Measure 74, beat 1: i54 in G major.

Measure 84, beat 1: V7[no3] in e minor.

Measure 87, beat 1: V7[no3] in e minor.

Measure 88, beat 1: V9[no3] in e minor.

Measure 117, beat 1: i54 in e minor.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.


BASS / INVERSION =====================

Total cases: 1

Overall bass note match: 99.65%.

In these cases, the specified bass note doesn't appear in the lowest part during. (NB: pedal points are not yet supported):

Measure 109, beat 2, iv6 in e, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: ['B2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.



WARNINGS =====================
WARNING: There are 141 measures in the score but 138 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The final chord in the analysis comes before the final measure, or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without an accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the HarmonicRanges will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
