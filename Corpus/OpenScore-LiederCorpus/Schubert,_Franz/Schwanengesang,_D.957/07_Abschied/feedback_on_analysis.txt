PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


RARE ROMAN NUMERALS =====================

No rare or unconventional Roman Numerals in this analysis.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

Total cases: 6

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:

Measure 3, V65/V in Eb appears on beat 4.5.

Measure 11, I64 in Eb appears on beat 4.5.

Measure 30, V65/V in Eb appears on beat 4.5.

Measure 61, I64 in Eb appears on beat 4.5.

Measure 80, V65/V in Eb appears on beat 4.5.

Measure 111, I64 in Eb appears on beat 4.5.


BASS / INVERSION =====================

The inversions look good: the bass note/s implied by the Roman numerals appear at least once in the lowest part during the relevant span.

WARNINGS =====================
WARNING: There are 167 measures in the score but 165 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The final chord in the analysis comes before the final measure, or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without an accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the HarmonicRanges will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
