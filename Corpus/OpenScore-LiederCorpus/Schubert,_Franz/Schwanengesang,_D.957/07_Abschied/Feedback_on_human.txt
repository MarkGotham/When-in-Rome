PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 3, V65/V in E- major appears on beat 4.5.
Measure 11, I64 in E- major appears on beat 4.5.
Measure 30, V65/V in E- major appears on beat 4.5.
Measure 61, I64 in E- major appears on beat 4.5.
Measure 80, V65/V in E- major appears on beat 4.5.
Measure 111, I64 in E- major appears on beat 4.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

The inversions look good: the bass notes implied by the Roman numerals do indeed appear at least once in the lowest part during the relevant span.

WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 167 measures in the score but 165 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The piece reaches its final chord before the final measure (in which case fine), or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the comparisons will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
