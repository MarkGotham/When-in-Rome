PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 13, V64 in c minor appears on beat 3.75.
Measure 14, V42/IV in c minor appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 18, V in c minor appears on beat 3.75.
Measure 20, iv6 in E- major appears on beat 1.75.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

The inversions look good: the bass note/s implied by the Roman numerals appear at least once in the lowest part during the relevant span.
