PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


RARE ROMAN NUMERALS =====================

Total cases: 11
The following Roman numerals are perfectly clear and the system has no trouble parsing them, though they are somewhat rare so may be worth reviewing:

Measure 7, beat 2: i54 in c minor.

Measure 43, beat 1: V[no3no5] in f# minor.

Measure 44, beat 1: V[no3no5] in f# minor.

Measure 44, beat 2: V42[no3no5] in f# minor.

Measure 44, beat 3: i6[no1] in f# minor.

Measure 44, beat 4: V64[no3] in f# minor.

Measure 46, beat 1: V[no3no5] in f# minor.

Measure 46, beat 2: V42[no3no5] in f# minor.

Measure 46, beat 3: i6[no1] in f# minor.

Measure 46, beat 4: V64[no3] in f# minor.

Measure 119, beat 1: i54 in c minor.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

Total cases: 4

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:

Measure 13, V64 in c appears on beat 3.75.

Measure 14, V42/IV in c appears on beat 1.75.

Measure 18, V in c appears on beat 3.75.

Measure 20, iv6 in Eb appears on beat 1.75.


BASS / INVERSION =====================

The inversions look good: the bass note/s implied by the Roman numerals appear at least once in the lowest part during the relevant span.
