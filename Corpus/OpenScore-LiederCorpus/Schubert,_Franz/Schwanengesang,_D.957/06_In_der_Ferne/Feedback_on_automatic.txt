WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 117 measures in the score but 115 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The piece reaches its final chord before the final measure (in which case fine), or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the comparisons will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
