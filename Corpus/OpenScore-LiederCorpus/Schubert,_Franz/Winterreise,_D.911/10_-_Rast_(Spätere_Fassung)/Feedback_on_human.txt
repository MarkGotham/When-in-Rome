PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 97.01%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 9, beat 1, V42 in c minor, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['C3', 'G3'].
How about:
m9 b1 V75#3


Measure 39, beat 1, V42 in c minor, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['C3', 'G3'].
How about:
m39 b1 V75#3
