PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 98.18%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 25, beat 3.5, VII7 in A major, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B#', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['F3', 'B3', 'D4', 'G#4'], ['E3', 'B3', 'D4', 'G#4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m25 b3.67 viio42 for the slice ['F3', 'B3', 'D4', 'G#4']

HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 75.0%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):

WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 32 measures in the score but 31 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The piece reaches its final chord before the final measure (in which case fine), or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the comparisons will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
