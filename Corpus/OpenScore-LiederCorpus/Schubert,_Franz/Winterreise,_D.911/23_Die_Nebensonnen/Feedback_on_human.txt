PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, V in A major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 2, I in A major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 5, V in A major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 6, I in A major appears on beat 1.75.

Measure 27, I in A major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 30, V7 in A major appears on beat 1.75.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

The inversions look good: the bass notes implied by the Roman numerals do indeed appear at least once in the lowest part during the relevant span.
