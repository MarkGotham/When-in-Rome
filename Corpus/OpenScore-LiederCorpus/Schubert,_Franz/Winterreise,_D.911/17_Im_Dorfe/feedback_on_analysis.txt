PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


RARE ROMAN NUMERALS =====================

Total cases: 8
The following Roman numerals are perfectly clear and the system has no trouble parsing them, though they are somewhat rare so may be worth reviewing:

Measure 6, beat 1: I54 in D major.

Measure 13, beat 3: Vb9 in D major.

Measure 17, beat 1: I54 in D major.

Measure 20, beat 3: V43[no3] in G major.

Measure 22, beat 3: V43[no3] in G major.

Measure 22, beat 4.67: V42[no3] in G major.

Measure 39, beat 3: I54 in D major.

Measure 45, beat 1: I54 in D major.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

Total cases: 10

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:

Measure 19, I6 in G appears on beat 4.67.

Measure 20, viio/ii in G appears on beat 2.67.

Measure 21, I in G appears on beat 1.33.

Measure 21, V64 in G appears on beat 1.67.

Measure 21, V64 in G appears on beat 2.67.

Measure 22, viio/ii in G appears on beat 2.67.

Measure 22, V42[no3] in G appears on beat 4.67.

Measure 23, I in G appears on beat 1.33.

Measure 23, V64 in G appears on beat 1.67.

Measure 23, V64 in G appears on beat 2.67.


BASS / INVERSION =====================

Total cases: 1

Overall bass note match: 98.98%.

In these cases, the specified bass note doesn't appear in the lowest part during. (NB: pedal points are not yet supported):

Measure 26, beat 1, V43 in D, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: ['D3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.



WARNINGS =====================
WARNING: There are 49 measures in the score but 46 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The final chord in the analysis comes before the final measure, or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without an accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the HarmonicRanges will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
