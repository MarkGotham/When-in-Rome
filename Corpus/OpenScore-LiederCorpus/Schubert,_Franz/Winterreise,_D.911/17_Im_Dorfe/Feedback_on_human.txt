PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.08%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 18, beat 1, I in D major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['D2', 'D4', 'E4', 'D5'], ['C#2', 'D4', 'D5'], ['D2', 'D4', 'D5'], ['C#2', 'D4', 'D5'], ['D2', 'D4'], ['C#2', 'D4'], ['D2'], ['C#2'], ['D2'], ['C#2'], ['D2'], ['C#2'], ['D2'], ['C#2'], ['D2'], ['C#2'], ['D2'], ['C#2'], ['D2'], ['C#2'], ['D2'], ['C#2'], ['D2'], ['C#2']].
Match strength estimated at 55.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 19, I6 in G major appears on beat 4.67.
Measure 20, viio/ii in G major appears on beat 2.67.
Measure 21, I in G major appears on beat 1.33.
Measure 21, V64 in G major appears on beat 1.67.
Measure 21, V64 in G major appears on beat 2.67.
Measure 22, viio/ii in G major appears on beat 2.67.
Measure 22, V42[no3] in G major appears on beat 4.67.
Measure 23, I in G major appears on beat 1.33.
Measure 23, V64 in G major appears on beat 1.67.
Measure 23, V64 in G major appears on beat 2.67.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 92.86%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 3, I6 in D major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['D3'].
How about:
m1 b3 I


Measure 2, beat 3, I6 in D major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['D3'].
How about:
m2 b3 I


Measure 7, beat 3, I6 in D major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['D3', 'A4'].
How about:
m7 b3 I


Measure 8, beat 3, I6 in D major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['D3', 'D5'].
How about:
m8 b3 I


Measure 26, beat 1, V43 in D major, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: ['D3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 31, beat 3, I6 in D major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['D3', 'A4'].
How about:
m31 b3 I


Measure 32, beat 3, I6 in D major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['D3', 'D5'].
How about:
m32 b3 I



WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 49 measures in the score but 46 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The piece reaches its final chord before the final measure (in which case fine), or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the comparisons will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
