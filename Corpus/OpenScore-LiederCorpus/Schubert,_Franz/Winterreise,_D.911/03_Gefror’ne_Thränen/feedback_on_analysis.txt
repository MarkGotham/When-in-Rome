PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.24%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 23, beat 2, viio/V in f minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [['B1', 'B2', 'A-4'], ['A-3', 'D4', 'F4', 'A-4'], ['A-3', 'D4', 'F4', 'A-4']].
Match strength estimated at 58.0%.
How about:
m23 b2.5 vio6#4 for the slice ['A-3', 'D4', 'F4', 'A-4']
m23 b2.75 vio6#4 for the slice ['A-3', 'D4', 'F4', 'A-4']


Measure 27, beat 2, viio/V in a- minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [['D2', 'D3', 'C-5'], ['C-4', 'F4', 'A-4', 'C-5'], ['C-4', 'F4', 'A-4', 'C-5']].
Match strength estimated at 58.0%.
How about:
m27 b2.5 vio6#4 for the slice ['C-4', 'F4', 'A-4', 'C-5']
m27 b2.75 vio6#4 for the slice ['C-4', 'F4', 'A-4', 'C-5']



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 5, V in A- major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 13, V in A- major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 14, I64 in A- major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 15, I64 in A- major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 16, I64 in A- major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 30, V in A- major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 31, I64 in A- major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 32, V in A- major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 33, I64 in A- major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 40, V in A- major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 41, I64 in A- major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 42, V in A- major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 43, I64 in A- major appears on beat 1.75.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

The inversions look good: the bass note/s implied by the Roman numerals appear at least once in the lowest part during the relevant span.
