In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 18, beat 4.5, viio65 in F major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B-', 'D-', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['F3', 'G3', 'E4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
