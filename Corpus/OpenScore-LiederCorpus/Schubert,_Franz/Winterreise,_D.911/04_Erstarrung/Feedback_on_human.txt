PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.9%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 44, beat 2, V6 in c minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [['B2', 'E-4', 'C5'], ['B2', 'G4', 'C5'], ['B2', 'G3', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 55.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

The inversions look good: the bass note/s implied by the Roman numerals appear at least once in the lowest part during the relevant span.

WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 109 measures in the score but 107 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The final chord in the analysis comes before the final measure, or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without an accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the HarmonicRanges will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
