PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 99.61%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 0, beat 2.67, I in A major, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: ['E4'].
How about:
m0 b2.67 I64



WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 44 measures in the score but 42 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The final chord in the analysis comes before the final measure, or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without an accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the HarmonicRanges will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
