PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.77%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 24, beat 1, viio65 in g minor, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C', 'E-', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['A2', 'G3', 'E-5'], ['A2', 'G3', 'E#4', 'F4', 'E-5']].
Match strength estimated at 53.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.

Match strength estimated at 53.0%.

HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

The inversions look good: the bass notes implied by the Roman numerals do indeed appear at least once in the lowest part during the relevant span.

WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 70 measures in the score but 69 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The piece reaches its final chord before the final measure (in which case fine), or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the comparisons will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
