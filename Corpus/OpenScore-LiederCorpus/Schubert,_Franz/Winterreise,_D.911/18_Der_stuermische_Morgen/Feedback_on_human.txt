PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 98.68%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, i in d minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'D4'], ['E3', 'E4'], ['C#3', 'C#4'], ['D3', 'D4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 3, I6 in d minor, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['F#3', 'F#4'], ['G3', 'G4'], ['E3', 'E4'], ['F#3', 'F#4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

Measure 8, IV43 in d minor appears on beat 3.5.
Measure 9, I in B- major appears on beat 4.5.
Measure 10, iiø42 in B- major appears on beat 2.5.
Measure 10, I6 in B- major appears on beat 4.5.
Measure 11, viio6 in B- major appears on beat 1.5.

Measure 16, iv64 in d minor appears on beat 4.5.
Measure 18, V in d minor appears on beat 2.5.
Measure 18, IV43 in d minor appears on beat 3.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

The inversions look good: the bass notes implied by the Roman numerals do indeed appear at least once in the lowest part during the relevant span.
