PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


RARE ROMAN NUMERALS =====================

No rare or unconventional Roman Numerals in this analysis.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.


BASS / INVERSION =====================

Total cases: 2

Overall bass note match: 97.39%.

In these cases, the specified bass note doesn't appear in the lowest part during. (NB: pedal points are not yet supported):

Measure 25, beat 1, V65 in a, indicating the bass G# for lowest note(s) of: ['A2', 'A1'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 69, beat 1, V65 in a, indicating the bass G# for lowest note(s) of: ['A2', 'A1'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.



WARNINGS =====================
WARNING: There are 89 measures in the score but 87 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The final chord in the analysis comes before the final measure, or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without an accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the HarmonicRanges will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
