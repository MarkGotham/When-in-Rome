PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 98.54%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 20, beat 3, i in e- minor, indicating the pitches ['E-', 'G-', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [['E-4', 'B-4', 'E-5', 'G-5'], ['D-5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 28, beat 1, v in e- minor, indicating the pitches ['B-', 'D-', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [['B-2'], ['B-2', 'B-3'], ['C-3'], ['C-3', 'C-4'], ['D-3'], ['D-3', 'D-4'], ['C-3'], ['C-3', 'C-4'], ['B-2'], ['B-2', 'B-3'], ['A-2'], ['A-2', 'A-3']].
Match strength estimated at 48.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 93.29%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 0, beat 3.5, viio7 in e- minor, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['C-4'].
How about:
m0 b3.5 viio64#2


Measure 2, beat 3.5, viio7 in e- minor, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['C-3'].
How about:
m2 b3.5 viio64#2


Measure 4, beat 1, viio7/vi in e- minor, indicating the bass B for lowest note(s) of: ['B-2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 4, beat 3.5, viio7 in e- minor, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['C-4'].
How about:
m4 b3.5 viio64#2


Measure 8, beat 3.5, viio7 in e- minor, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['C-4'].
