PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 98.45%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 31, beat 2, viio65[no5]/V in e minor, indicating the bass C# for lowest note(s) of: ['B2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 31, beat 3, V64/V in e minor, indicating the bass C# for lowest note(s) of: ['B2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
