PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 95.31%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 23, beat 1, V9 in b minor, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['C#3', 'G3', 'G2', 'E3'].
How about:
m23 b1 V#6543


Measure 29, beat 2.5, viio7/V in c minor, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['G1'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 34, beat 1.5, Ger65 in b minor, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: ['E#2', 'B1', 'D2'].
How about:
m34 b1.5 #ivob64b3
m34 b1.5 #ivob6b42


Measure 41, beat 2.5, viio7/V in c minor, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['G1'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.



WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 48 measures in the score but 46 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The piece reaches its final chord before the final measure (in which case fine), or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the comparisons will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
