PITCH COVERAGE =====================

Total cases: 6

Overall pitch match: 94.63%.

In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 0, beat 2.5, i6 in g, indicating the pitches ['Bb4', 'D5', 'G5'] accounting for successive chord "slices" of [['Bb3', 'G4'], ['C4', 'A4']].
Pitch match: 50.0%
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 2.5, IV in g, indicating the pitches ['C5', 'E5', 'G5'] accounting for successive chord "slices" of [['C3'], ['D3']].
Pitch match: 50.0%
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 7, beat 2.5, iio43[no3] in g, indicating the pitches ['Eb5', 'Gb5', 'A5'] accounting for successive chord "slices" of [['Eb3', 'G4', 'A4'], ['Eb3', 'G4', 'Bb4']].
Pitch match: 50.0%
How about:
m7 b2.75 bVI for the pitches ['E-3', 'G4', 'B-4']


Measure 21, beat 2.5, I6 in G, indicating the pitches ['B4', 'D5', 'G5'] accounting for successive chord "slices" of [['B3', 'G4'], ['C4', 'A4']].
Pitch match: 50.0%
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 40, beat 2.5, i in g, indicating the pitches ['G4', 'Bb4', 'D5'] accounting for successive chord "slices" of [['G4'], ['A4']].
Pitch match: 50.0%
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 42, beat 2.5, iio43[no3] in g, indicating the pitches ['Eb5', 'Gb5', 'A5'] accounting for successive chord "slices" of [['Eb3', 'G4', 'A4'], ['Eb3', 'G4', 'Bb4']].
Pitch match: 50.0%
How about:
m42 b2.75 bVI for the pitches ['E-3', 'G4', 'B-4']



RARE ROMAN NUMERALS =====================

Total cases: 5
The following Roman numerals are perfectly clear and the system has no trouble parsing them, though they are somewhat rare so may be worth reviewing:

Measure 7, beat 2.5: iio43[no3] in g minor.

Measure 19, beat 2: i54 in g minor.

Measure 42, beat 2.5: iio43[no3] in g minor.

Measure 54, beat 2: i54 in g minor.

Measure 72, beat 1: i64[no3] in g minor.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

Total cases: 4

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:

Measure 9, V42 in g appears on beat 2.25.

Measure 9, viio6 in g appears on beat 2.75.

Measure 44, V42 in g appears on beat 2.25.

Measure 44, viio6 in g appears on beat 2.75.


BASS / INVERSION =====================

Total cases: 1

Overall bass note match: 99.7%.

In these cases, the specified bass note doesn't appear in the lowest part during. (NB: pedal points are not yet supported):

Measure 41, beat 2.5, VI in g, indicating the bass Eb for lowest note(s) of: ['C3', 'D3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.



WARNINGS =====================
WARNING: There are 84 measures in the score but 82 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The final chord in the analysis comes before the final measure, or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without an accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the HarmonicRanges will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
