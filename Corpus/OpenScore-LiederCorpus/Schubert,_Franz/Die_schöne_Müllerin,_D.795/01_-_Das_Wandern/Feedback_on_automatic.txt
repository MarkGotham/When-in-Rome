PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 98.1%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 14, beat 2.5, v in B- major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A-', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['A1', 'A2', 'C3', 'A4'], ['G1', 'G2', 'C4', 'B-4']].
Match strength estimated at 24.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 15, beat 1.5, V7 in B- major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A', 'C', 'E-'] accounting for successive slices of [['G1', 'G2', 'C3', 'B-4'], ['G1', 'G2', 'C4', 'B-4']].
Match strength estimated at 24.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 96.25%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 13, beat 1.5, V in B- major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['A1'].
How about:
m13 b1.5 V6


Measure 14, beat 2.5, v in B- major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['A1', 'G1'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 15, beat 1.5, V7 in B- major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['G1'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
