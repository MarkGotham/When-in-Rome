PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 95.87%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 11, beat 2, i in b minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['D#3', 'F#4', 'F#5'], ['D#3', 'F#4', 'F#5'], ['D#3', 'F#4'], ['D#3', 'F#4']].
Match strength estimated at 59.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 14, beat 1, i in b minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['F#3', 'C#4', 'F#4', 'A4'], ['F#3', 'C#4', 'F#4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m14 b1 v for the slice ['F#3', 'C#4', 'F#4', 'A4']
m14 b1.25 v for the slice ['F#3', 'C#4', 'F#4', 'A4']


Measure 16, beat 1, I in b minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'A3', 'F#4', 'F#5'], ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4', 'F#5'], ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4', 'F#5'], ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4'], ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4'], ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4'], ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4'], ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4']].
Match strength estimated at 38.0%.
How about:
m16 b1 III for the slice ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4', 'F#5']
m16 b1.25 III for the slice ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4', 'F#5']
m16 b1.5 III for the slice ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4', 'F#5']
m16 b1.75 III for the slice ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4']
m16 b2 III for the slice ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4']
m16 b2.25 III for the slice ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4']
m16 b2.5 III for the slice ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4']
m16 b2.75 III for the slice ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4']


Measure 20, beat 2.5, i in b minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['D#3', 'F#4'], ['D#3', 'F#4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 75.0%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 6, beat 2, v6 in b minor, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: ['C#4'].
How about:
m6 b2 v64


Measure 6, beat 2.5, V65 in b minor, indicating the bass A# for lowest note(s) of: ['C#4'].
How about:
m6 b2.5 V#643


Measure 8, beat 2.5, v in b minor, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['A3'].
How about:
m8 b2.5 v6


Measure 11, beat 1, I in b minor, indicating the bass B for lowest note(s) of: ['D#3'].
How about:
m11 b1 I#863
