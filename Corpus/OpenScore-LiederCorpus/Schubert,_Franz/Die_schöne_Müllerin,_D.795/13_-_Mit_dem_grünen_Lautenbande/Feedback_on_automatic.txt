PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 96.86%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 7, beat 2, V in B- major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'A3', 'F#4', 'D5'], ['D5']].
Match strength estimated at 12.0%.
How about:
m7 b2 III for the slice ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4', 'D5']


Measure 18, beat 1, II in B- major, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [['E-3', 'B-3', 'G4', 'F5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 91.25%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):

Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.

How about:
m10 b1 ii65

Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
