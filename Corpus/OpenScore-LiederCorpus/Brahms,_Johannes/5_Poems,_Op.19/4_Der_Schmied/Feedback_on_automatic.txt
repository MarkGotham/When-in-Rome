PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 75.0%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 5, beat 1, V7 in B- major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['B-2', 'B-1'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 5, beat 3.5, V in B- major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['B-2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
