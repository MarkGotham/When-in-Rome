PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 97.88%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 22, beat 1.33, viio64 in B major, indicating the pitches ['E', 'A#', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [['B1', 'B2', 'E4', 'E5'], ['B1', 'B2', 'A#4', 'C#5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 22, beat 1.67, viio65[no5] in B major, indicating the pitches ['C#', 'G', 'A#'] accounting for successive slices of [['B1', 'B2', 'C#4', 'C#5'], ['B1', 'B2', 'G4', 'A#4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 22, beat 2, viio7 in B major, indicating the pitches ['A#', 'C#', 'E', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [['B1', 'B2', 'A#3', 'A#4'], ['B1', 'B2', 'E4', 'G4'], ['B1', 'B2', 'A#3', 'G4'], ['B1', 'B2', 'D#4', 'F#4'], ['B1', 'B2', 'A#3', 'F#4'], ['B1', 'B2', 'C#4', 'E4']].
Match strength estimated at 36.0%.
How about:
m22 b2.17 iv64 for the slice ['B1', 'B2', 'E4', 'G4']
m22 b2.5 I for the slice ['B1', 'B2', 'D#4', 'F#4']



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 96.38%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):

Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 22, beat 1.67, viio65[no5] in B major, indicating the bass C# for lowest note(s) of: ['B1'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
