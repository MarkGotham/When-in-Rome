PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 91.28%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 3, V7 in E- major, indicating the pitches ['B-', 'D', 'F', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [['E-2', 'E-3', 'A-3', 'D4', 'A-4'], ['E-2', 'E-3', 'B-3', 'A-4'], ['E-2', 'E-3', 'A-3', 'D4', 'A-4']].
Match strength estimated at 57.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
