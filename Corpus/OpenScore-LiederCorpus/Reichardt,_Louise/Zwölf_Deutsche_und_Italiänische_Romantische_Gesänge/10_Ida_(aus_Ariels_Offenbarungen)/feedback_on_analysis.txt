PITCH COVERAGE =====================

Total cases: 2

Overall pitch match: 92.21%.

In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 11, beat 1, i64 in f, indicating the pitches ['C5', 'F5', 'Ab5'] accounting for successive chord "slices" of [['Cb3', 'Ab3', 'Cb4', 'F4', 'Cb5'], ['Cb3', 'Ab3', 'Cb4', 'F4', 'Cb5']].
Pitch match: 40.0%
How about:
m11 b1 io64 for the pitches ['C-3', 'A-3', 'C-4', 'F4', 'C-5']
m11 b1.5 io64 for the pitches ['C-3', 'A-3', 'C-4', 'F4', 'C-5']


Measure 11, beat 2, V in f, indicating the pitches ['C5', 'E5', 'G5'] accounting for successive chord "slices" of [['Cb3', 'Gb3', 'Bb3', 'E4'], ['Cb3', 'Gb3', 'Bb3', 'E4']].
Pitch match: 25.0%
How about:
m11 b2 bv#75##3 for the pitches ['C-3', 'G-3', 'B-3', 'E4']
m11 b2.5 bv#75##3 for the pitches ['C-3', 'G-3', 'B-3', 'E4']



RARE ROMAN NUMERALS =====================

Total cases: 1
The following Roman numerals are perfectly clear and the system has no trouble parsing them, though they are somewhat rare so may be worth reviewing:

Measure 53, beat 1: i54 in e- minor.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.


BASS / INVERSION =====================

Total cases: 3

Overall bass note match: 96.36%.

In these cases, the specified bass note doesn't appear in the lowest part during. (NB: pedal points are not yet supported):

Measure 11, beat 1, i64 in f, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: ['Cb3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 11, beat 2, V in f, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: ['Cb3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 38, beat 1, viio43 in eb, indicating the bass Ab for lowest note(s) of: ['Eb2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.



WARNINGS =====================
WARNING: There are 55 measures in the score but 54 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The final chord in the analysis comes before the final measure, or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without an accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the HarmonicRanges will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
