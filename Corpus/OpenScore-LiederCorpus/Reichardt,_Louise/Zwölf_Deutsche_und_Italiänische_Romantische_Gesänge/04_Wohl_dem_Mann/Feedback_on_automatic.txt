PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 96.67%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 0, beat 3, I in A- major, indicating the pitches ['A-', 'C', 'E-'] accounting for successive slices of [['A-4', 'C5'], ['B-4', 'D-5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 5, beat 3, I in A- major, indicating the pitches ['A-', 'C', 'E-'] accounting for successive slices of [['A-4', 'C5'], ['B-4', 'D-5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 88.33%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 4, beat 3, V7 in A- major, indicating the bass E- for lowest note(s) of: ['G4'].
How about:
m4 b3 V65


Measure 7, beat 1, I in A- major, indicating the bass A- for lowest note(s) of: ['E-3'].
How about:
m7 b1 I64


Measure 9, beat 1, I in A- major, indicating the bass A- for lowest note(s) of: ['E-3'].
How about:
m9 b1 I64
