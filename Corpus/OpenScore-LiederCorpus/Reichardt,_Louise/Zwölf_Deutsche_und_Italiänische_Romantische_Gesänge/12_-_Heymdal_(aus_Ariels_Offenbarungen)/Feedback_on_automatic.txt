PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.09%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 8, beat 1.67, V in D major, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C#', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['A3', 'A5'], ['F#4', 'G5'], ['F#4', 'F#5']].
Match strength estimated at 51.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 98.15%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 2, beat 1, V7 in D major, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: ['C#3'].
How about:
m2 b1 V65
