PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 98.27%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 16, beat 1, V64 in F major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'C', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'C4', 'F4'], ['C3', 'F4']].
Match strength estimated at 58.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 19, beat 1.5, I/IV in F major, indicating the pitches ['B-', 'D', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'A4'], ['C3', 'F4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 22, beat 1, V64 in F major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'C', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'C4', 'F4'], ['C3', 'F4']].
Match strength estimated at 58.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 90.22%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):

How about:
m9 b2 V43


Measure 16, beat 1, V64 in F major, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: ['C3'].
How about:
m16 b1 V


Measure 16, beat 1.5, I in F major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['C3'].

How about:
m21 b2.5 ii6
