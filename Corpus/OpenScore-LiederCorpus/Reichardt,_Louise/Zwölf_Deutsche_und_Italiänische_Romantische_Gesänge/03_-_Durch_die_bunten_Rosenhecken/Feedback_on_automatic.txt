PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 96.61%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 3, beat 1, vii6 in f minor, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['B-3', 'G4'], ['B-3', 'D-4', 'F4', 'G4']].
Match strength estimated at 38.0%.
How about:
m4 b1.5 ii√∏65 for the slice ['B-3', 'D-4', 'F4', 'G4']


Measure 6, beat 3, vo7 in f minor, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E-', 'G-', 'B--'] accounting for successive slices of [['B-3', 'G5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:

Measure 3, viio7/V in f minor appears on beat 3.5.
