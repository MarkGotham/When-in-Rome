PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

The inversions look good: the bass notes implied by the Roman numerals do indeed appear at least once in the lowest part during the relevant span.
