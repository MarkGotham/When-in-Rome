PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 94.76%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 2.67, i64 in g minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'G', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [['G3', 'C4', 'E-4', 'C5', 'E-5']].
Match strength estimated at 20.0%.
How about:
m1 b2.67 iv64 for the slice ['G3', 'C4', 'E-4', 'C5', 'E-5']


Measure 5, beat 2.67, i in g minor, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B-', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['G3', 'C4', 'E-4', 'C5', 'E-5']].
Match strength estimated at 20.0%.
How about:
m5 b2.67 iv64 for the slice ['G3', 'C4', 'E-4', 'C5', 'E-5']


Measure 7, beat 1, ii in g minor, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'E-4', 'E-5'], ['C3', 'G4', 'E-5']].
Match strength estimated at 34.0%.
How about:
m7 b1.33 iv for the slice ['C3', 'G4', 'E-5']


Measure 7, beat 1.67, v in g minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'B-4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 33.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 8, beat 2, I in g minor, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['B-4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 82.05%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 2.67, i64 in g minor, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['G3'].
How about:
m1 b2.67 i


Measure 3, beat 2.67, V7/V in g minor, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: ['C#4'].
How about:
m3 b2.67 II#865#3


Measure 5, beat 2, iv in g minor, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: ['G3'].
How about:
m5 b2 iv64


Measure 7, beat 1, ii in g minor, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: ['C3'].
How about:
m7 b1 ii6


Measure 7, beat 1.67, v in g minor, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['C3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 8, beat 2, I in g minor, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: ['B-4'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 8, beat 2.33, VII in g minor, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['A4'].
How about:
m8 b2.33 bVII6


Measure 9, beat 1.33, viio6 in g minor, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: ['C3'].
How about:
m9 b1.33 viio6#4


Measure 9, beat 2, viio65/V in g minor, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: ['C#3'].
How about:
m9 b2 #ivob7b53


Measure 11, beat 1, i6 in g minor, indicating the bass B- for lowest note(s) of: ['D3'].
How about:
m11 b1 i64


Measure 11, beat 1.33, i in g minor, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: ['D3'].
How about:
m11 b1.33 i64



WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 14 measures in the score but 13 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The piece reaches its final chord before the final measure (in which case fine), or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the comparisons will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
