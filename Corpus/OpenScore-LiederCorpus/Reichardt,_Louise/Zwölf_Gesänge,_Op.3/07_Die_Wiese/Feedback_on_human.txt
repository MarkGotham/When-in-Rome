PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 97.22%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 11, beat 1, iv in a minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['F5'], ['E5'], ['D5'], ['C5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 94.44%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 2, beat 2.67, V43 in C major, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['F3'].
How about:
m2 b2.67 V42


Measure 5, beat 1, I in C major, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: ['E5'].
How about:
m5 b1 I6
