PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 95.33%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 17, beat 3, vi in F major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['C4'], ['A3']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 21, beat 1, I in F major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'E4', 'G4', 'E5'], ['E4', 'G4', 'C5'], ['E4', 'G4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 28.0%.
How about:
m21 b1 V for the slice ['C3', 'E4', 'G4', 'E5']
m21 b3 V6 for the slice ['E4', 'G4', 'C5']
m21 b3.75 V6 for the slice ['E4', 'G4', 'C5']


Measure 24, beat 1, V7 in F major, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E', 'G', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [['D4', 'F4', 'F5'], ['C4', 'E4', 'E5'], ['B-3', 'D4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 44.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.
