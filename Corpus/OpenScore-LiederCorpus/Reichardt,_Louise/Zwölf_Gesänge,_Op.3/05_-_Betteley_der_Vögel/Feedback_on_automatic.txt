PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 98.65%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 9, beat 2, II in G major, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C#', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['A3', 'C5'], ['A3', 'G4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 42.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 18, beat 1.5, V in G major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'G4', 'B4'], ['D3', 'D4', 'G4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m18 b1.5 I64 for the slice ['D3', 'G4', 'B4']



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 95.0%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 9, beat 1.5, I in G major, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: ['B3'].
How about:
m9 b1.5 I6


Measure 15, beat 1, V7 in G major, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['A3'].
How about:
m15 b1 V43


Measure 18, beat 1, I in G major, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: ['D3'].
How about:
m18 b1 I64



WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 20 measures in the score but 19 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The piece reaches its final chord before the final measure (in which case fine), or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the comparisons will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
