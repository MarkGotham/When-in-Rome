PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 98.46%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 9, beat 1.67, I64 in A major, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: ['C#4', 'A4'].
How about:
m9 b1.67 I6
