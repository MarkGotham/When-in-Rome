PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 80.36%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 0, beat 3, I in F major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [[], ['A4'], ['A4'], ['B-4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 4, beat 4, VII7 in F major, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G#', 'B', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['C#2', 'C#3', 'E4', 'B-4'], ['C#2', 'C#3', 'G4', 'B-4']].
Match strength estimated at 12.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 5, beat 2.5, i in F major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A-', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['D2', 'D3', 'A4'], ['D2', 'D3', 'F4', 'A4'], ['D2', 'D3', 'D4', 'D5'], ['D2', 'D3', 'F4', 'D5'], ['D2', 'D3', 'A4', 'F5'], ['D2', 'D3', 'F4', 'F5'], ['D2', 'D3', 'D4', 'E5'], ['D2', 'D3', 'F4', 'E5'], ['D2', 'D3', 'A4', 'D5'], ['D2', 'D3', 'F4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 17.0%.
How about:
m6 b2.75 vi for the slice ['D2', 'D3', 'F4', 'A4']
m6 b3.5 vi for the slice ['D2', 'D3', 'A4', 'F5']


Measure 6, beat 1, v in F major, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E-', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [['A1', 'A2', 'E4', 'D5'], ['A1', 'A2', 'G4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 12.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 6, beat 1.5, V7 in F major, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E', 'G', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [['A1', 'A2', 'A4', 'D5'], ['A1', 'A2', 'G4', 'D5'], ['A1', 'A2', 'E4', 'C#5'], ['A1', 'A2', 'G4', 'C#5'], ['A1', 'A2', 'A4', 'C#5'], ['A1', 'A2', 'G4', 'C#5'], ['A1', 'A2', 'E4'], ['A1', 'A2', 'G4'], ['A1', 'A2', 'A4', 'C#5'], ['A1', 'A2', 'G4', 'C#5'], ['A1', 'A2', 'E4', 'C#5'], ['A1', 'A2', 'G4', 'C#5'], ['A1', 'A2', 'A4', 'C#5'], ['A1', 'A2', 'G4', 'C#5']].
Match strength estimated at 20.0%.
How about:
m7 b2 III for the slice ['A1', 'A2', 'E4', 'C#5']
m7 b4 III for the slice ['A1', 'A2', 'E4', 'C#5']


Measure 7, beat 1, i in F major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A-', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'D4', 'D5'], ['D3', 'F4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 17.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 4, V7/VI in F major appears on beat 4.5.
Measure 5, i in F major appears on beat 2.5.
Measure 6, V7 in F major appears on beat 1.5.
Measure 7, vi in F major appears on beat 1.5.
Measure 8, V in F major appears on beat 1.5.
Measure 8, V in F major appears on beat 2.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 69.86%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 0, beat 3, I in F major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['B-4', 'A4'].
How about:
m0 b3 I6


Measure 4, beat 4, VII7 in F major, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: ['C#2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 4, beat 4.5, V7/VI in F major, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: ['C#2'].
How about:
m4 b4.5 III#8653


Measure 5, beat 2.5, i in F major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['D2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 6, beat 1, v in F major, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: ['A1'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 6, beat 1.5, V7 in F major, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: ['A1'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 7, beat 1, i in F major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['D3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 9, beat 1, I in F major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['C3'].
How about:
m9 b1 I64



WARNINGS =====================

It looks like there's a Roman numeral allocated before the start of any notes.
Please check and correct if so.
Roman numeral I in F major, m.0: No pitches in one of the slices.
