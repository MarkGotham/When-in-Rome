PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 97.92%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 3, beat 2.33, IV in F major, indicating the pitches ['B-', 'D', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [['C4', 'C5'], ['B-3', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 91.67%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 0, beat 2.67, I in F major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['C4'].
How about:
m0 b2.67 I64


Measure 5, beat 2.67, IV in F major, indicating the bass B- for lowest note(s) of: ['F3'].
How about:
m5 b2.67 IV64


Measure 6, beat 1.33, IV in F major, indicating the bass B- for lowest note(s) of: ['F3'].
How about:
m6 b1.33 IV64


Measure 6, beat 2, I6 in F major, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: ['C4'].
How about:
m6 b2 I64
