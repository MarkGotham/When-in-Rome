PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 96.2%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 3, beat 2, i64 in f minor, indicating the pitches ['C', 'F', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [['G3', 'E4', 'B-4'], ['G3', 'C4', 'B-4']].
Match strength estimated at 17.0%.
How about:
m3 b2 viio#63 for the slice ['G3', 'E4', 'B-4']


Measure 5, beat 2, vi6 in f minor, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['F3', 'F4', 'D-5'], ['F3', 'A-4', 'D-5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m5 b2.25 bVI6 for the slice ['F3', 'A-4', 'D-5']



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 82.86%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 0, beat 2.5, i in f minor, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['C4'].
How about:
m0 b2.5 i64


Measure 3, beat 2, i64 in f minor, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: ['G3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 5, beat 2.5, i6 in f minor, indicating the bass A- for lowest note(s) of: ['F3'].
How about:
m5 b2.5 i


Measure 6, beat 1, viio65/V in f minor, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['F3'].
How about:
m6 b1 #ivob864b3


Measure 6, beat 2, viio7/V in f minor, indicating the bass B for lowest note(s) of: ['F3'].
How about:
m6 b2 #ivob864b3



WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 10 measures in the score but 8 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The piece reaches its final chord before the final measure (in which case fine), or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the comparisons will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
