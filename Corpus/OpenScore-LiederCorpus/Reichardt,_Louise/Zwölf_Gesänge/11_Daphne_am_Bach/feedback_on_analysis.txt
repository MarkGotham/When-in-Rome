PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


RARE ROMAN NUMERALS =====================

Total cases: 2
The following Roman numerals are perfectly clear and the system has no trouble parsing them, though they are somewhat rare so may be worth reviewing:

Measure 6, beat 1: I[add9] in A- major.

Measure 10, beat 1: V[add4][no3] in A- major.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.


BASS / INVERSION =====================

Total cases: 1

Overall bass note match: 98.44%.

In these cases, the specified bass note doesn't appear in the lowest part during. (NB: pedal points are not yet supported):

Measure 0, beat 2.5, I in Ab, indicating the bass Ab for lowest note(s) of: ['Eb4'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
