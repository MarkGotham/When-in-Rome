PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 95.84%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 0, beat 2.33, V in D major, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C#', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['F#4'], ['G4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 1.67, V in D major, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C#', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'F#4', 'D5'], ['D3', 'A4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 17.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 92.65%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 0, beat 2.33, V in D major, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: ['F#4', 'G4'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 1.67, V in D major, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: ['D3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 5, beat 2.67, ii in D major, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: ['G3'].
How about:
m5 b2.67 ii6


Measure 7, beat 2.67, ii in D major, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: ['G3'].
How about:
m7 b2.67 ii6
