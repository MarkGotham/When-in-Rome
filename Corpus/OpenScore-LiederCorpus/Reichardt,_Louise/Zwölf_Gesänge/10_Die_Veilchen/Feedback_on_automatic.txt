PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 97.1%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 8, beat 2.5, V in G major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'C#4', 'C#5']].
Match strength estimated at 33.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 16, beat 1, i in G major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B-', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['A2', 'A3', 'C4', 'A4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 21, beat 1, V in G major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'B3', 'G4'], ['D3', 'D4', 'G4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m21 b1 I64 for the slice ['D3', 'B3', 'G4']



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 93.48%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 6, beat 1, V65 in G major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['A3'].
How about:
m6 b1 V43


Measure 8, beat 2, V7/V in G major, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: ['D3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 11, beat 1, V7 in G major, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['F#3'].
How about:
m11 b1 V65


Measure 16, beat 1, i in G major, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: ['A2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.



WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 23 measures in the score but 22 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The piece reaches its final chord before the final measure (in which case fine), or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the comparisons will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
