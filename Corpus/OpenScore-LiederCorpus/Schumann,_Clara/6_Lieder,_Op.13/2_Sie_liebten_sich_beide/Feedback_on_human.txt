PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.22%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 19, beat 2, V42 in g minor, indicating the pitches ['C', 'D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['G2', 'C4', 'E-4', 'F#4', 'B-4'], ['G2', 'C4', 'E-4', 'F#4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 47.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.

Bass note match: 81.86%.
