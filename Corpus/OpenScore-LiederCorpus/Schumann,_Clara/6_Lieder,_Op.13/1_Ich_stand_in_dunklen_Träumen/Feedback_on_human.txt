PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 97.48%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 4, beat 3, V+43 in E- major, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A-', 'B-', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['F#3', 'B-3', 'A4', 'F5'], ['F#3', 'B-3', 'A4', 'E-5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 34, beat 3, V+43 in E- major, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A-', 'B-', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['F#3', 'B-3', 'A4', 'F5'], ['F#3', 'B-3', 'A4', 'E-5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 36, beat 1, I in E- major, indicating the pitches ['E-', 'G', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [['E-2', 'B-2', 'A-3', 'D4', 'F4']].
Match strength estimated at 40.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 96.85%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 12, beat 1, V7/ii in B- major, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: ['E-3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 20, beat 3, V42/iii in E- major, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: ['E-3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 23, beat 1, viio43/V in c minor, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: ['E-3'].
How about:
m23 b1 #ivob642


Measure 31, beat 3, viio6 in E- major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['E-3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
