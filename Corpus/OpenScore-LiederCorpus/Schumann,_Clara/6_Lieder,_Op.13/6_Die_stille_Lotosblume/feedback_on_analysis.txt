PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 97.95%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 4, beat 1, viio6/vii in A- major, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['A-2', 'C5'], ['A-3', 'B--3', 'E-4', 'F#4', 'C5'], ['A-3', 'B--3', 'E-4', 'F#4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 43.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
