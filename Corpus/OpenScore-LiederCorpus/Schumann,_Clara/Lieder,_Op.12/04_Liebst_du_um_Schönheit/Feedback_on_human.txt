PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 90.85%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 3, ii in D- major, indicating the pitches ['E-', 'G-', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [['E-3', 'B-3', 'D-4', 'F4', 'A-4'], ['E-3', 'D-4', 'F4', 'G-4', 'A-4']].
Match strength estimated at 40.0%.

BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 94.82%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 9, beat 1, ii7 in b- minor, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: ['E-2'].
How about:
m9 b1 ii65#3


Measure 16, beat 2.5, ii7 in D- major, indicating the bass E- for lowest note(s) of: ['G-3'].
How about:
m16 b2.5 ii65


Measure 16, beat 3, i6 in D- major, indicating the bass F- for lowest note(s) of: ['F3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 32, beat 2.5, ii7 in D- major, indicating the bass E- for lowest note(s) of: ['G-3'].
How about:
m32 b2.5 ii65


Measure 32, beat 3, i6 in D- major, indicating the bass F- for lowest note(s) of: ['F3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 34, beat 2.5, vi6 in D- major, indicating the bass D- for lowest note(s) of: ['F2'].
How about:
m34 b2.5 vi64


Measure 35, beat 2.5, viio65/V in D- major, indicating the bass B- for lowest note(s) of: ['G3'].
How about:
m35 b2.5 #ivo7
