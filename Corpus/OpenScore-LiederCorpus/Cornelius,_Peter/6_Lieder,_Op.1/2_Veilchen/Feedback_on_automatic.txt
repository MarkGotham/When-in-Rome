PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 98.52%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 5, beat 3, VII7 in A- major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [['E3', 'B-3', 'D-4', 'F#5', 'G5']].
Match strength estimated at 20.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 96.3%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 5, beat 3, VII7 in A- major, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: ['E3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 6, beat 3, V7 in A- major, indicating the bass E- for lowest note(s) of: ['G3'].
How about:
m6 b3 V65
