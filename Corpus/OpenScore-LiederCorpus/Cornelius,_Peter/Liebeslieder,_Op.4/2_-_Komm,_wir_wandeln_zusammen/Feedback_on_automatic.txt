WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 48 measures in the score but 46 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The piece reaches its final chord before the final measure (in which case fine), or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the comparisons will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.

It looks like there's a Roman numeral allocated before the start of any notes.
Please check and correct if so.
Roman numeral V7 in D- major, m.1: No pitches in one of the slices.
