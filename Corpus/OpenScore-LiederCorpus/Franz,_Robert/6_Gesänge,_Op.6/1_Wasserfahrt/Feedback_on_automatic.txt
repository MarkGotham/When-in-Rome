PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 97.65%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 3, beat 1, I in F# major, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A#', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [['B3', 'D#4', 'F#4', 'D#5', 'F#5'], ['A#3', 'C#4', 'F#4', 'A#4', 'C#5'], ['B3', 'D#4', 'F#4', 'B4', 'D#5']].
Match strength estimated at 44.0%.
