PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.

BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 99.04%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 14, beat 2.5, I6 in D major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['A2'].
How about:
m14 b2.5 I64


Measure 15, beat 1.75, IV6 in D major, indicating the bass B for lowest note(s) of: ['A2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
