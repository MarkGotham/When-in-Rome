PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.72%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 20, beat 1, Ger65 in B major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D', 'E#'] accounting for successive slices of [['F#2', 'G3', 'F5', 'B5', 'F6']].
Match strength estimated at 40.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 85.85%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 2, beat 2, V9 in B major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['C#4'].
How about:
m2 b2 V6543


Measure 4, beat 2, V9 in B major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['C#4'].
How about:
m4 b2 V6543


Measure 20, beat 1, Ger65 in B major, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: ['F#2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 22, beat 2, V9 in B major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['C#4'].
How about:
m22 b2 V6543


Measure 24, beat 2, V9 in B major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['C#4'].
How about:
m24 b2 V6543


Measure 32, beat 2, V9 in B major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['C#4'].
How about:
m32 b2 V6543


Measure 34, beat 2, V9 in B major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['C#4'].
How about:
m34 b2 V6543


Measure 36, beat 3, V43/iii in E major, indicating the bass A# for lowest note(s) of: ['D#3'].
How about:
m36 b3 VII7#5#3


Measure 51, beat 2, V9 in B major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['C#4'].
How about:
m51 b2 V6543


Measure 53, beat 2, V9 in B major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['C#4'].
How about:
m53 b2 V6543


Measure 69, beat 1, I in B major, indicating the bass B for lowest note(s) of: ['F#3'].
How about:
m69 b1 I64



WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 72 measures in the score but 69 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The final chord in the analysis comes before the final measure, or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without an accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the HarmonicRanges will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
