PITCH COVERAGE =====================

Total cases: 1

Overall pitch match: 95.33%.

In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 20, beat 1, Ger65 in B, indicating the pitches ['G5', 'B5', 'D6', 'E#6'] accounting for successive chord "slices" of [['F#2', 'G3', 'F5', 'B5', 'F6']].
Pitch match: 40.0%
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.

WARNINGS =====================
WARNING: There are 72 measures in the score but 69 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The final chord in the analysis comes before the final measure, or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without an accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the HarmonicRanges will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
