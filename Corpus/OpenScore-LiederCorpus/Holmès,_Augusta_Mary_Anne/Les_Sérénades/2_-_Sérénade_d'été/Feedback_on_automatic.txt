PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.36%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 39, beat 3, IV6 in A- major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A-', 'D-'] accounting for successive slices of [['F-3', 'A-3', 'C-4', 'A-4', 'C-5', 'E--5', 'A-5'], ['F-3', 'A-3', 'C-4', 'A-4', 'C-5', 'E--5', 'G-5']].
Match strength estimated at 38.0%.
How about:
m39 b3 bVI75#3 for the slice ['F-3', 'A-3', 'C-4', 'A-4', 'C-5', 'E--5', 'A-5']


Measure 39, beat 3.5, I in A- major, indicating the pitches ['A-', 'C', 'E-'] accounting for successive slices of [['G-5'], ['F-5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 98.04%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 39, beat 3, IV6 in A- major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['F-3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 39, beat 3.5, I in A- major, indicating the bass A- for lowest note(s) of: ['G-5', 'F-5'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 40, beat 1, I in A- major, indicating the bass A- for lowest note(s) of: ['E-1'].
How about:
m40 b1 I64


Measure 42, beat 1, I in A- major, indicating the bass A- for lowest note(s) of: ['E-3'].
How about:
m42 b1 I64



WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 44 measures in the score but 43 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The piece reaches its final chord before the final measure (in which case fine), or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the comparisons will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
