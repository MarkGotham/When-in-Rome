PITCH COVERAGE =====================

Total cases: 2

Overall pitch match: 93.81%.

In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 4, beat 1, viio42 in c, indicating the pitches ['Ab4', 'B4', 'D5', 'F5'] accounting for successive chord "slices" of [['C3', 'Ab3', 'B3', 'F4'], ['C3', 'G3', 'C4', 'Eb4']].
Pitch match: 56.25%
How about:
m4 b1.75 i for the pitches ['C3', 'G3', 'C4', 'E-4']


Measure 20, beat 1, viio42 in c, indicating the pitches ['Ab4', 'B4', 'D5', 'F5'] accounting for successive chord "slices" of [['C3', 'Ab3', 'B3', 'F4'], ['C3', 'G3', 'C4', 'Eb4']].
Pitch match: 56.25%
How about:
m20 b1.75 i for the pitches ['C3', 'G3', 'C4', 'E-4']

WARNINGS =====================
WARNING: There are 36 measures in the score but 35 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The final chord in the analysis comes before the final measure, or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without an accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the HarmonicRanges will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
