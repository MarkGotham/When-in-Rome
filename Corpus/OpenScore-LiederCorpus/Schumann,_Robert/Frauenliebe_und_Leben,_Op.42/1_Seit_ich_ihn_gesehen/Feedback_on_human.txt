PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.19%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 4, beat 1, viio42 in c minor, indicating the pitches ['A-', 'B', 'D', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'A-3', 'B3', 'F4'], ['C3', 'G3', 'C4', 'E-4']].
Match strength estimated at 56.0%.
How about:
m4 b1.75 i for the slice ['C3', 'G3', 'C4', 'E-4']


Measure 20, beat 1, viio42 in c minor, indicating the pitches ['A-', 'B', 'D', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'A-3', 'B3', 'F4'], ['C3', 'G3', 'C4', 'E-4']].
Match strength estimated at 56.0%.
How about:
m20 b1.75 i for the slice ['C3', 'G3', 'C4', 'E-4']



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 9, I6 in B- major appears on beat 3.75.
Measure 10, V43 in c minor appears on beat 3.75.
Measure 25, I6 in B- major appears on beat 3.75.
Measure 26, V43 in c minor appears on beat 3.75.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 98.15%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 4, beat 1, viio42 in c minor, indicating the bass A- for lowest note(s) of: ['C3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 20, beat 1, viio42 in c minor, indicating the bass A- for lowest note(s) of: ['C3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.



WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 36 measures in the score but 35 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The final chord in the analysis comes before the final measure, or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without an accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the HarmonicRanges will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
