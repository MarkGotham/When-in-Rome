PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 98.92%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 26, beat 2.5, ii in E- major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A-', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['F2', 'B-4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 27, beat 1, ii in E- major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A-', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['C#2', 'B-4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 30, beat 2.5, IV in G- major, indicating the pitches ['C-', 'E-', 'G-'] accounting for successive slices of [['C-3', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 97.84%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 27, beat 1, ii in E- major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['C#2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 27, beat 1.5, viio7/vii in E- major, indicating the bass C# for lowest note(s) of: ['E3'].
How about:
m27 b1.5 #vio6b5b3


Measure 31, beat 1, iio65 in E- major, indicating the bass A- for lowest note(s) of: ['F2', 'C-3'].
How about:
m31 b1 iiob864b3
m31 b1 iiob7b53
