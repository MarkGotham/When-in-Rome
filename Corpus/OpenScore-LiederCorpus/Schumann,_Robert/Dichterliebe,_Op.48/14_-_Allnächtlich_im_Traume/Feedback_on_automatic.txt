PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 97.75%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 3, beat 2, V6 in B major, indicating the pitches ['A#', 'C#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['E#2', 'E#3', 'C#4', 'G#4', 'C#5'], ['E#2', 'E#3', 'C#4', 'G#4']].
Match strength estimated at 33.0%.
How about:
m3 b2 II6 for the slice ['E#2', 'E#3', 'C#4', 'G#4', 'C#5']
m3 b2.5 II6 for the slice ['E#2', 'E#3', 'C#4', 'G#4']

Measure 38, beat 1.5, V in B major, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A#', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [].

Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
