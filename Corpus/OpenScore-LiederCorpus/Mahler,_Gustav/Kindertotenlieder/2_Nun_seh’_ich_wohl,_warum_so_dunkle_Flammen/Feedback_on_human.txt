HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 89.86%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):

How about:
m35 b1 #ivobb8b6b42


Measure 37, beat 2, Ger65/II in E- major, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['D-2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 38, beat 1, Ger65/II in E- major, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['G#4', 'D-2', 'G4'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.

WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 74 measures in the score but 73 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The piece reaches its final chord before the final measure (in which case fine), or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the comparisons will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.

It looks like there's a Roman numeral allocated before the start of any notes.
Please check and correct if so.
Roman numeral i6 in g minor, m.1: No pitches in one of the slices.
