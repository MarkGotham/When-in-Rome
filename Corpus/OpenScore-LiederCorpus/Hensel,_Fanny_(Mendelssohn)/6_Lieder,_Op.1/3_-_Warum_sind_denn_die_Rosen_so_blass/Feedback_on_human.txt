PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.38%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 12, beat 1, I in F major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['D2', 'D3', 'F4', 'D5'], ['D2', 'D3', 'A4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 24.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 29, beat 1, I in F major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['D2', 'D3', 'F4', 'D5'], ['D2', 'D3', 'A4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 24.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 99.19%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 12, beat 1, I in F major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['D2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 29, beat 1, I in F major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['D2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
