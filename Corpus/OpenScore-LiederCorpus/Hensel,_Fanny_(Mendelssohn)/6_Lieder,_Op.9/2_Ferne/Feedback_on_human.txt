PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 83.19%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 16, beat 1, V in g minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['E-2', 'G3', 'C5'], ['E-2', 'C4', 'C5'], ['E-2', 'E-4', 'C5'], ['E-2', 'G4', 'C5'], ['E-2', 'C4', 'C5'], ['E-2', 'E-4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m13 b1 iv6 for the slice ['E-2', 'G3', 'C5']
m13 b2.5 iv6 for the slice ['E-2', 'G4', 'C5']


Measure 17, beat 1, V65 in g minor, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A', 'C', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['E-2', 'G3', 'E-5'], ['E-2', 'C4', 'E-5'], ['E-2', 'E-4', 'E-5'], ['E-2', 'G4', 'E-5'], ['E-2', 'C4', 'D5'], ['E-2', 'E-4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 23.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 18, beat 1, i in g minor, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B-', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['E-3', 'G3', 'C#5'], ['E-3', 'B-3', 'C#5'], ['E-3', 'E-4'], ['E-3', 'G4'], ['E-3', 'B-3'], ['E-3', 'E-4']].
Match strength estimated at 28.0%.
How about:
m15 b1 It6 for the slice ['E-3', 'G3', 'C#5']


Measure 20, beat 1, bII65 in g minor, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E-', 'G-', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [['F#2', 'A3', 'D5'], ['F#2', 'D4', 'D5'], ['F#2', 'F#4', 'D5'], ['F#2', 'A4', 'D5'], ['F#2', 'D4', 'C5'], ['F#2', 'F#4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 12.0%.
How about:
m17 b1 V6 for the slice ['F#2', 'A3', 'D5']
m17 b2.5 V6 for the slice ['F#2', 'A4', 'D5']


Measure 22, beat 1, iv6 in g minor, indicating the pitches ['E-', 'G', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['B-2', 'G3', 'G4'], ['B-2', 'B-3', 'G4'], ['B-2', 'D4', 'G4'], ['B-2', 'G4'], ['B-2', 'B-3', 'G4'], ['B-2', 'D4', 'G4']].
Match strength estimated at 43.0%.
How about:
m19 b2 i6 for the slice ['B-2', 'D4', 'G4']
m19 b3.5 i6 for the slice ['B-2', 'D4', 'G4']


Measure 24, beat 1, V7 in g minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'B3', 'G4'], ['D3', 'F4', 'G4'], ['D3', 'G4'], ['D3', 'G4', 'B4'], ['D3', 'F4', 'G4'], ['D3', 'G4']].
Match strength estimated at 40.0%.
How about:
m21 b1 I64 for the slice ['D3', 'B3', 'G4']
m21 b2.5 I64 for the slice ['D3', 'G4', 'B4']



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 70.37%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 16, beat 1, V in g minor, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['E-2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 17, beat 1, V65 in g minor, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['E-2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 18, beat 1, i in g minor, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: ['E-3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 19, beat 1, i6 in g minor, indicating the bass B- for lowest note(s) of: ['D3'].
How about:
m19 b1 i64


Measure 20, beat 1, bII65 in g minor, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: ['F#2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 21, beat 1, V43/iv in g minor, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['G2'].
How about:
m21 b1 I75#3


Measure 22, beat 1, iv6 in g minor, indicating the bass E- for lowest note(s) of: ['B-2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 23, beat 1, V7[add4] in g minor, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['C3'].
How about:
m23 b1 V65#42
