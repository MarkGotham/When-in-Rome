PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 92.0%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 0, beat 3.67, I in A- major, indicating the bass A- for lowest note(s) of: ['C4'].
How about:
m0 b3.67 I6


Measure 5, beat 2, IV6 in D- major, indicating the bass B- for lowest note(s) of: ['D-3'].
How about:
m5 b2 IV64


Measure 6, beat 1.67, viio in D- major, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: ['D-3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
