PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.65%.
In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 11, beat 3, viio6/V in A major, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A', 'D#'] accounting for successive slices of [['E2', 'F#3', 'A4', 'D#5'], ['E2', 'F#3', 'E4', 'A4'], ['E4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 59.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 42, beat 3, viio6/V in A major, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A', 'D#'] accounting for successive slices of [['E2', 'F#3', 'A4', 'D#5'], ['E2', 'F#3', 'E4', 'A4'], ['E4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 59.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 10, I64 in A major appears on beat 2.67.
Measure 12, I in A major appears on beat 2.67.
Measure 41, I64 in A major appears on beat 2.67.
Measure 43, I in A major appears on beat 2.67.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

I rate the bass notes at about 96.84%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedals are not currently supported):
Measure 11, beat 3, viio6/V in A major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['E2', 'E4'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 11, beat 4, V6 in A major, indicating the bass G# for lowest note(s) of: ['E2', 'E4'].
How about:
m11 b4 V


Measure 28, beat 1, I64 in E major, indicating the bass B for lowest note(s) of: ['G#4'].
How about:
m28 b1 I6


Measure 42, beat 3, viio6/V in A major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['E2', 'E4'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 42, beat 4, V6 in A major, indicating the bass G# for lowest note(s) of: ['E2', 'E4'].
How about:
m42 b4 V


Measure 43, beat 2, V+6 in A major, indicating the bass G# for lowest note(s) of: ['E3'].
How about:
m43 b2 V+


Measure 43, beat 2.67, I in A major, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: ['E3'].
How about:
m43 b2.67 I64


Measure 43, beat 3, I64 in A major, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: ['C#4'].
How about:
m43 b3 I6



WARNINGS =====================

WARNING: There are 63 measures in the score but 59 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The piece reaches its final chord before the final measure (in which case fine), or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the comparisons will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
