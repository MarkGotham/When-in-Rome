PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


RARE ROMAN NUMERALS =====================

Total cases: 2
The following Roman numerals are perfectly clear and the system has no trouble parsing them, though they are somewhat rare so may be worth reviewing:

Measure 21, beat 1: V9/v in E major.

Measure 22, beat 1: V9/v in E major.


HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

Total cases: 4

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:

Measure 10, I64 in A appears on beat 2.67.

Measure 12, I in A appears on beat 2.67.

Measure 41, I64 in A appears on beat 2.67.

Measure 43, I in A appears on beat 2.67.


BASS / INVERSION =====================

Total cases: 8

Overall bass note match: 96.84%.

In these cases, the specified bass note doesn't appear in the lowest part during. (NB: pedal points are not yet supported):

Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.

WARNINGS =====================
WARNING: There are 63 measures in the score but 59 in your analysis. This is usually a question of either the beginning or end: either
1) The final chord in the analysis comes before the final measure, or
2) There's an anacrusis in the score without an accompanying harmony (i.e. the analysis is missing measure 0). In that latter case, the score and analysis will be misaligned, and the HarmonicRanges will not work properly. Best to put in a chord of some kind for the anacrusis.
