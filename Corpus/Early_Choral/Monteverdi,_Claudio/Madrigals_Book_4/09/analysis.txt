Note: m26-27 repeated a step higher in m28-29
m26 I || b3 I
m27 b4 IV
m28 I
m29 a: i b4 iv
m30 i
Note: certain amount of "noodling among secondary diatonic chords" through this section; tonality unclear.  Passage is largely focused on an extremely long Pachelbel sequence (6 steps!).
m31 III b3 VII
m32 i
Note: interesting moment here, either the C anticipates the coming F chord (but is not an anticipation) or the B is a pedal.

m34 VI
m35 III
m36 iv
m37 i d: v
m38 VI
m39 III
m40 iv g: i

Note: most of the time from here until almost then end, the tonal centre is relatively obscure; there are very few clear key-defining cadences.
m42 b3 i6/4
m43 b3 v7
m44 i
m45 V6 b4 V
Note: very brief key change to C major, supported by common cadential I6/4-V progression
m46 I6 b3 I
Note: m47ff a transposed repetition of m38ff, up by step, lightly altered
m47 vi6 b3 IV6/4
Note: awesome crunch in 48: 6/4 suspensions over a full triad
m48 I
m49 a: i6/4
