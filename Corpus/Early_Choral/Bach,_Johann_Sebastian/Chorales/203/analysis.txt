Time Signature: 3/4
 
m1 g: i b2 i6 b3 c: V b3.5 V7
Note: very pungent progression from Eb augmented to f# diminished seventh.  One could explain it away by treating B natural as a quarter-note passing tone, but it sure sounds weird in any case.
m2 i b2 III+ b3 g: viio4/3
m3 i6 b2 i
m4 V6 || b3 i
m5 d: V2 b2 i6 b3 V6/5
m6 i b2 iv7 b3 V7
m7 I || b3 g: V b3.5 V2
m8 i6 b2 i b3 i6
Note: the Eb could be another quarter-note neighbor
m9 V b2 viio6/5 b3 V2 b3.5 V4/3
m10 i6 b2 iv6/5
m11 V || b3 V
m12 V b3 V6/4
m13 i b3 i6
m14 V ||
m15 V b2 V6 b3 V6/5 b3.5 V7
Note: fauxbourdon ROTO variant, tonicizing iv
m16 i b3 v6
m17 iv6 b2 IV2/iv b3 viio6/iv
m18 iv || b3 V
Note: apparent ii-IV progression, but the iv6 chord is better read as an incomplete ii/o4/3.  This is an interesting passage to consider more deeply.
m19 i b2 i6 b3 iio6
m20 ii/o4/3 b2 ii/o6/5 b3 V b3.5 V7
m20var1 iv6 b2 ii/o6/5 b3 V b3.5 V7
m21 I ||
