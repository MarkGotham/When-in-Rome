m1var1 IV b1.5 viio6/4 b2 I b3 V b3.5 V7 b4 vi d: i
m2 d: ii/o6/5 b2 V b2.5 V7 b3 i || b4 V/iv
m3 iv F: ii b2 V2 b3 I6 b3.5 I b4 V b4.5 V7
m4 I :|| b4 I
Note: the following passage could be heard in F with a tonicization of ii; the bass creates a pretty strong emphasis on G however.  It feels like the key starts changing but turns back.
Note: this is an interesting passage from the standpoint of theorizing key changes.
m5 vi b2 g: V2 b3 i6 b4 i
m5var1 vi b2 V2/ii b3 ii6 b4 ii
Note: the F6 chord, in G would be a V6/III tending toward Bb.  Here, however, it brings us back to the tonic.
m6 F: I6 b3 V || b4 V6
m7 I b2 viio7/ii b3 ii b4 d: viio7/V
m8 V b2 V7 b3 VI || b4 F: viio6/ii
