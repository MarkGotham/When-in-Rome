Time Signature: 4/4

Note: lots of clashing nonharmonic tones here, suggesting iii6 chords (m1, m 8), augmented chords (m 1), etc.  See also m3, b1.
m0 b4 a: i
m1 i b2 V6 b2.5 V6/5 b3 i b4 IV6 G: V6
Note: doubled leading tone, part of an alto descending arpeggio
Note: soprano D moves up across cadence, perhaps suggesting chord is viio6
m2 I b1.5 ii7 b2.5 a: VI6 b3 viio6 || b4 V6
m3 i b2 VImaj7 b3 i6/4 b4 V b4.5 V7
m4 i :|| b4 i
Note: tenor either leaps away from a dissonance, never to resolve it stepwise.  It could be conceived either as a suspension (ala Moteverdi) or a seventh.  Perhaps the note is resolved in the alto an octave away.
Note: the decorated suspension resolution E4-A3-D4 would not be so unusual; what makes this passage really strange is the E4 at the cadence.
Note: I am reading this as two chords because Bach *sometimes* leaps away from a seventh; on the variant reading, the nonharmonic tone is sui generis in the chorales
m5 ii b1.5 viio6 b2 i6 b2.5 iv7 b3 V b4 VImaj7 b4.5 iv6
m5var1 ii b1.5 viio6 b2 i6 b2.5 iv7 b3 V b4 iv6
m6 V || b4 V
m7 i b2 V6/III b3 III G: IV b4 ii
Note: "three voice fauxbourdon" (against a fixed pedal) at the start of m8; worth investigating further.
m8 V6 b2 V7 b3 I || b4 a: V6
m9 i b2 V2/III b3 III6 b4 IIImaj7
Note: next measure is complicated; relying on the parallels with m8
m10 IV b1.5 III+6 b2 iv6/5 b2.5 iv7 b3 V || b4 i6
