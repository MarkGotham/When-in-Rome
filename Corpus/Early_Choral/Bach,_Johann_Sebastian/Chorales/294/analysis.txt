m0 b4 b: i
Note: the tenor on beat 1 is an interesting figure; can be either ii/o4/3 or iv6.  Look for it throughout the chorales?
m1 iv6 b2 V b2.5 V2 b3 i6 b4 ii b4.5 viio6
m2 i b2 V b2.5 V7 b3 i || b4 i b4.5 D: viio6/V
m3 V b1.5 V2 b2 V4/3 b3 I b4 b: IV2 b4.5 viio6
m4 i b2 i6 b3 V :|| b4 D: I
Note: rare V-ii-[VI-iv]-V progression; to me the iio6 chord sounds a little like viio4/3 with a missing leading tone, going to a deceptive VI on beat 1 of the next measure.  The important point is the missing resolution of the leading tone to ^1, which would sound more like a V-iv progression.
m5 V b1.5 V7 b2 vi b: i b3 V b4 iio6
m5var1 V b1.5 V7 b2 vi b: i b3 V b4 viio4/3
m6 VI b1.5 iv7 b2 V b2.5 V7 b3 i || b4 A: ii b4.5 viio6
m7 I b2 f#: IV6/5 b2.5 viio b3 i
m8 i b2 iv6 A: ii6 b2.5 V b3 I || b4 b: V6
Note: interesting case of V6/III between i and i6
Note: clear parallel fifths, tenor-bass, b4-b4.5; possible to read ii6 with a retardation (B-C#) but this is a bit of a stretch.  Other editions have a tenor D (dotted quarter) on beat 3, which makes a lot more sense, but I am following Riemenschneider here.
Note: modal v7
m9 i b2 V6/III b2.5 V6/5/III b3 i6 b4 IV b4.5 v7
