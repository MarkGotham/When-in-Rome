m0 b4 b: i D: vi
Note: doubled leading tone
m1 IV b1.5 vii/o4/3 b2 I6 b3 ii7 b3.5 viio6 b4 vi6
m2 ii6/5 b: iv6/5 b3 V || b4 V
m3 i b2 i6 b3 V b4.5 V7
m4 i :|| b4 i
Note: the start of the phrase feels like B minor; in D it is viio6-I with leading tone in melody, resolving down
m5 iio6 b2 D: I6 b3 IV b4 viio6
m6 I6 b1.5 G: V6/5 b2 I b3 V || b4 V b4.5 V7
m7 vi6 b2 e: ii/o7 b2.5 V4/3 b3 i b3.5 i6 b4 i
m8 V || b4 A: V6/5
Note: alto leaps up to the major seventh on beat 4.5
m9 I b2 I6 b3 IV6 b3.5 V6/5 b4 I b4.5 Imaj7
m10 ii6 b2 V b3 I || b4 D: I
m11 IV6 b2 I b3 V6
Note: barely gets back to B minor in time, with beat 1 both being tonic in D (decorated with either one or two suspensions) and dominant in B minor.  Note that the E4 is a suspension relative to Dmaj7 (or b6) and a *harmonic tone* relative to F#4/3!
Note: this happens elsewhere in the chorales (#231).  A decorated suspension has the decorating tone harmonized.  Very Schenkerian.
