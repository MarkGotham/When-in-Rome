Time Signature: 3/4

Note: very interesting chorale because of deliberate parallelism between phrases; interesting from a methodological standpoint vis-a-vis "Quinn critique" and viio6-ii progressions etc.  Bach seems to deliberately use incomplete chords to create ambiguity, with the same progression being read in opposite ways depending on mode.  I think of this as a very clever pun.
Note: here I am reading in the way that brings out the stereotypical progressions (which is how I tend to hear).  The variant reading emphasizes parallelism.
Note: this should be discussed at length
m1 g: i b3 V6
Note: III lacks fifth, which will become important
m2 i b2 V6/III b2.5 V6/5/III b3 III
m3 IV6/5 b2 viio b3 i
m4 ii/o6/5 b2 V b2.5 V7 b3 i ||
Note: I6 lacks roots; could be iii with missing fifth.  iii would be parallel to the opening, whereas I6 is more common.
m5 Bb: I b2 viio6 b3 I6
m5var1 Bb: I b2 viio6 b3 iii
Note: I chord is again incomplete; Bach is reusing the same voice-leading pattern
m6 vi b2 V6 b2.5 V6/5 b3 I
m7 ii6/5 b2 ii7 b3 V b3.5 V7
m8 I :||
m9 F: I b3 V6
Note: phrase very closely parallels opening; same methodological issues
