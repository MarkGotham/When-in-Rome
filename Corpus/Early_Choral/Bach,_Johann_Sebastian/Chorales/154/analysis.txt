Time Signature: 4/4

Note: beautiful, fascinating, repetitive modal chorale.  My theory here is that it is a G major chorale, obeying completely functional progressions, but with a lowered leading tone.  (All of the voice leading is very familiar if you simply imagine an F#.)  Off tonic beginning.  G: should be read as G quasi mixolydian.
m0 b4 G: v
Note: common parallel-fifths idiom, top voices D-A, C-G.
m1 IV6 b2 I b3 v b3.5 v7 b4 vi
m2 ii6/5 b2 V b2.5 V7 b3 I || b4 v
Note: interesting to compare the V7 resolutions in m. 2 and 4; phrases are identical otherwise.  Presumably Bach is preparing for the voicing at the end of m4.
m3 IV6 b2 I b3 v b3.5 v7 b4 vi
m4 ii6/5 b2 V b2.5 V7 b3 I || b4 C: IV
m5 viio6 b2 I b3 ii6 b3.5 V6/5/V b4 V
m6 I b1.5 d: viio7 b2 i b3 V || b4 G: v b4.5 v7
Note: now there is a vi on the downbeat
