Time Signature: 4/4

Form: chorale
Note: chorale has very unusual progressions, chromatic chords, and a pronounced modal flavor
m1 a: V2 b3 i6 b4 viio6
Note: unusual use of dorian #6, b7
m2 i b2 VII6 b3 III b4 vio6
m3 V ||
Note: doubled seventh, one resolves upward
m4 i C: vi b2 V7 b2.5 V2 b3 I6 b4 IV
m5 I b2 ii a: iv b3 V :||
m6 i6 b3 VII6 b4 i b4.5 viio6/VII
m7 VII b2 iv6 b3 iio6 b4 V
m7var1 VII b2 iv6 b3 iv7 b4 V
m8 i || b3 i
m9 v b2 III C: I b3 V6 b3.5 V6/5 b4 I G: IV
m10 I6/4 b2 V7 b3 I ||
Note: this is some kind of modally influenced plagal cadence; I've analyzed the G minor chord as a iv6/iv, though one could argue for a very brief turn to D minor.
Note: piece ends with a long string of ascending fifths: F-C-g-d-(E)-a-E.  Cf. chorale 16.
m11 IV b3 ii a: i b4 V b4.5 V7
Note: the progression on m12b3 - m13b1 strongly suggests d minor: iv6-i6/4-V6/5/V.  Leaving it in A minor because the phrase starts there.
m12 VI b2 III b3 iv6/iv b4 iv6/4
m13 V6/5 b2 i b3 V
