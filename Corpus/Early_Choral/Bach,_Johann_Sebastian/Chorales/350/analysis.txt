m1 Bb: I b2 IV6 b3 iii b4 vi7
m2 ii b1.5 viio6 b2 I b3 V ||
Note: near-complete circle of fifths, missing IV
m3 I b2 viio6 b3 iii b4 vi
m4 ii6/5 b2 V b3 I :||
m5 c: IV b2 viio6 b3 i b4 i6
Note: double anticipation figure when V resolves to i (3rd and root both anticipated)
m6 V b2 V7 b3 i ||
m7 Eb: vi b2 V b2.5 V2 b3 I6 b4 I
m8 V b2.5 V7 b3 I ||
Note: this next measure is tonally ambiguous; on the page it makes complete sense in Bb, but coming after Eb, there is a tendency to hear in Eb.  However, the larger melodic context suggests Bb.

m10 V6/5 b2 I b3 V ||
m11 I b2 IV6 b3 V6 b3.5 V b4 I
