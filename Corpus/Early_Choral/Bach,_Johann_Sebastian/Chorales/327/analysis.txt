Time Signature: 4/4

Note: this is a very interesting chorale, with lots of unusual harmony.  A couple different "passing 6/4 chords"
m0 b4 D: I
m1 I b2 G: V2 b3 vi6/4 b4 viio6
m2 I b3 IV || b4 IVmaj2
m3 D: V6/5/vi b2 vi b3 ii6/5 b4 V
m4 I || b4 A: I
Note: incomplete neighbor in tenor, b1.5
m5 V6 b2 V7 b3 I b4 V/ii
m6 ii b3 ii || b4 D: vi
Note: seventh vanishes from b4, but F# appears in m8 as expected.
m7 viio6 b2 I b3 V7 b4 V
m8 I :|| b4 V
m9 V b2 V2 b3 iii b4 V7
m10 I b3 I || b4 I
m11 I b2 G: V2 b3 vi6/4 b4 viio6
m12 I6 D: IV6 b2 V6/5 b3 I || b4 e: V6
m13 i b2 iio6 b3 V
m14 i :|| b4 b: V6
Note: this next passage is strange and tonally ambiguous; it's a variant of the fauxbourdon ROTO, with III6/4 in place of v6 (third substitution), and lots of tonicization of iv.  
m15 i b2 III6/4 b3 iv6 b4 viio6/iv
Note: fake i6 where it should be on beat 2, but with a soprano G.  Reading the chord as a passing chord here, but from a fauxbourdon ROTO perspective it is significant.
Note: iv6/4 inside a voice exchange viio6/5->V7
m16 iv b3 viio6/5 || b4 iv6/4
m17 V6/5 b2 i b3 D: V6/5/V b4 V 
m18 I ||
