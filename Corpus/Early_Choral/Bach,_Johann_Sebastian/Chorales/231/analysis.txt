Time Signature: 4/4
Note: key signature is blank

Note: modal melody, odd progression of keys, interesting
m0 b4 G: I
m1 V6 b2 V2/IV b3 IV6 b4 V6/5
m2 I || b3 a: V6/5/iv b4 iv 
m3 V2 b2 i6 b3 ii/o6/5 b4 V b4.5 V7
m4 i || b4 C: vi
Note: this phrase begins with vi-I6-I-IV in C, which is a very stereotypical progression, and the whole phrase can be analyzed past the cadence in that key.  However, the cadence on D is odd, and suggests a kind of modal dominant of the global tonic G.
Note: the alto suspension on beat 3 is very interesting.  The suspended G on b3 "stands for" F and is nonharmonic.  But on b3.5 the G is the harmonic tone and the F itself is nonharmonic.  So the suspension becomes a chordal dissonance before resolving!
m5 I6 b2 I b3 IV b3.5 V2/ii b4 ii6
Note: next phrase echoes the first
m6 ii || b4 V b4.5 V2
m7 I6 G: IV6 b2 V6 b3 I b4 V b4.5 V7
m8 I || b4 I
m9 V6 b2 I C: V b2.5 V2 b3 I6 b4.5 I
m10 IV || b4 I6 G: IV6
m11 V6/5 b2 I b3 IV b4 V6/5/V
m12 V || b4 I6
Note: "weak beat 6/4" part of fauxbourdon ROTO pattern.  Could be analyzed away.
