Time Signature: 4/4

Note: this first phrase is interesting because it appears to have to iii chords in it, both of which I think are illusory.  
Note: Analyszing the first iii chord as a (temporarily incomplete) Imaj6/5.  The leapt-to-anticipation is unusual, and the harmonic rhythm is 2 beats in this first measure.
m1 C: I b2 Imaj6/5 b3 IV
m1var1 C: I b2 iii b3 IV
Note: the second iii chord is a common idiom
m2 ii b2 V b2.5 V2 b3 I6 b4 IV
m3 I || b4 V
Note: descending fifths sequence V-I-IV-viio-iii-vi in C, or ending ii-v-i in a
m4 I b1.5 I6 b2 V b2.5 V2 b3 I6 b3.5 I b4 IV
m5 viio6 a: iio6 b1.5 iio b2 v b3 i6 b4 i b4.5 i6
m6 V || b4 e: i
Note: parallel fifths, soprano/tenor, fairly common formulation
m7 V6 b1.5 V6/5 b2 i b3 a: IV6 b4 V6
m8 i || b3 C: V6 b3.5 V6/5 b4 I
m9 G: V6/5 b2 I b3 IV6 b3.5 IV b4 V
m10 I || b3 I b4 viio6
m11 I6 b2 V6/5/ii b3 ii b4 V
m12 I || b3 V b3.5 V2 b4 I6
Note: the following measure is interesting from a methodological standpoint, as you could find iii chords and vii chords on beat 2.  Note the 8-note sequence of parallel thirds/tenths
m13 I b1.5 V2/IV b2 V4/3/IV b3 IV b4 V b4.5 V7
m14 vi || b3 C: V b3.5 V7 b4 I
Note: the end seems like it will cadence in G then turns surprisingly to C (discursive modulation!)
m15 vi G: ii b1.5 viio6 b2 I b3 V6 b3.5 V6/5 b4 I
m16 C: ii b2 V7 b3 I ||
