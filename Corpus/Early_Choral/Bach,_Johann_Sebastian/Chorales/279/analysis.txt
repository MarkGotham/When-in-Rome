Time Signature: 4/4

Note: cool chorale, lots of chromatic harmony
m0 b4 Bb: I
m1 V b2 V/V b2.5 V7/V b3 V || b4 V2
Note: very cool V2-vi/o4/3-viio6/5 progression in major (modal mixture)
Note: pivot chord modulation by way of diminished seventh, which resolves as a plagal dominant
m2 vi/o4/3 b2 viio6/5 g: viio4/3 b3 i || b4 V6/5
Note: the idiomatic but weird V2-I progression that appears a lot
Note: the F major chord on b4 never appears (should catalogue how often this occurs in the chorales)
m3 i b2 v F: vi b3 V2 b4 I
m4 V b3 I || b4 Bb: I6
m5 viio6 b2 I b3 V || b4 V
m6 Eb: V7 b2 V7/IV b3 IV || b4 Bb: V6/5
Note: three dominant sevenths in a row, moving up by M2
m7 d: IV6/5 b2 V6/5 b3 VI6 Bb: I6
m8 viio7/vi b2 vi b3 V6/5/V b4 v
Note: modal ending perhaps makes most sense in Eb minor.
Note: tenor suspension (b2, F) resolves to a stronger beat (b3, Eb)
m9 V6/5/iv b2 iv b3 iv6 b4 iv6/4
m10 I ||
