Time Signature: 3/4
 
Note: very tricky chorale with lots of bass movement
m1 d: i
m2 i b1.5 V6 b2 i b3 i6
Note: neighboring iio6 between i6/4 and V7
m3 i6/4 b2 iio6 b3 V b3.5 V7
m4 i ||
m5 i b2 i6 b3 v
m6 VI F: IV b2 IV6 b3 I
m7 IV b2 ii7 b3 V7
m8 I :||
m9 vi
m10 I6 b2 V b3 vi
m11 IV6 b2 I b3 I6
m12 V ||
Note: discursive modulation
m13 V b2 g: i6 b3 V6
m14 i b2 VI b3 iv6
m14var1 i b2 i6/4 b3 iv6
Note: very interesting chord on beat 3: soprano has Bb, while tenor leaps to and from A. I am reading the soprano as a nonharmonic tone -- exactly as in the Schenkerian story.  Another option is a seventh chord.
m15 iv7 b2 ii/o6/5 b3 V
m15var1 iv7 b2 ii/o6/5 b3 III+maj6/5
m16 i ||
Note: next measure could be heard in D minor, because of the C#
m17 F: vi b3 vi6 b3.5 vi
m17var1 F: vi b3 vi6 b3.5 IV6
m18 V6 b1.5 V b2 V6 b3 I
m19 IV6 b2 I b3 I6
m20 V ||
m21 I6 b3 I
Note: main reading has one large D minor chord.  Variant has a i-v6-VI7 in D minor
m22 vi b3 vi6/4
m22var1 vi b2 iii6 b3 IVmaj7
Note: variant has upward resolution of I6/4; main reading hears just two chords
m23 ii6 b1.5 ii b2 V b3 V4/3
m23var1 ii6 b1.5 ii b2 I6/4 b3 viio6
m24 I ||
m25 I b1.5 I6 b2 I6/4 b2.5 I b3 V6
m26 I b2 I6 b3 V
Note: here the F resolves across voices? tricky
m27 I C: IV b2 V4/3 b2.5 V7
m27var1 I C: IV b2 viio6 b3 V
m28 I ||
m29 d: iv b2 i6 b3 V6
Note: here, the tenor articulates a standard suspension figure with decoration, but the neighboring note gets harmonized; arguably the A7 chord is nonharmonic
m30 i b1.5 i6 b2 ii/o6/5 b2.5 V7 b3 VI
Note: briefly a tripled root of the iio6 chord, bare tritone
m31 iv7 b2 iio6 b2.5 iio b3 V b3.5 V7
m32 I ||
