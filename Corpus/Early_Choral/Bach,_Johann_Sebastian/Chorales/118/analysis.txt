Time Signature: 4/4
 
m0 b4 Bb: I
Note: figure on m4 recalls the V-IV6/4 idiom, with V6 and an alto PT.
m1 vi b2 iii b3 V6 b4 I
m1var1 vi b2 iii b3 V6 b4 IV6/4 b4.5 Imaj7
m2 ii2 b2 viio6/4/IV b3 IV6 b3.5 IV b4 V b4.5 V7
m3 I || b2 IV b3 c: viio6/5/V b4 viio
m4 i b2 i6 Bb: ii6 b2.5 vii/o4/3 b3 I6 b4 ii6/5/V b4.5 V/V
Note: odd passing diminished chord in the bass
m5 V || b2 V6/5/vi b3 vi b4 viio6/4/IV
Note: reading D as harmonic on b4 creates parallel fifths, disguised by an anticipation.  The alternative is to make the C harmonic, but that seems like a stretch, given the lines.  Worth discussing this passage, and the cognate iv7-V, which also has parallels.
m6 V6/5 b2 I b3 vi b3.5 b4 vii/o7/V 
m7 V || b2 I b3 IV b4 viio6/ii
Note: quarter note suspension in alto
m8 ii || b2 Eb: iii b3 IV b4 viio6
m9 I || b2 Bb: I b3 V b3.5 V7 b4 vi
m10 V6 b2 V b2.5 V7 b3 V6/5/vi b4 IV6
