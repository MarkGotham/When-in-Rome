Note: in the following, it is possible to read the tenor line either as a series of anticipations (V7-VI-?) or as genuine suspensions (see variant), or as eighth-note harmonies, or as EQE neighbors!
Note: worth discussing this passage, given all these possibilities; despite all the ambiguity, it's still pretty clearly a V-VI followed by a standard schema (VI-i6/4-viio4/3)
