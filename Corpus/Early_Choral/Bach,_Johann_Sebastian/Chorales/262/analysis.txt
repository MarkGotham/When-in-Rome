m0 b4 g: V

m6 i b2 iv6 b3 V || b4 i
Note: Eb here echoes the strong Neapolitan early; note the nice III+6 dominant.
m7 N Bb: IV b1.5 vii/o4/3 b2 I6 b2.5 vii/o7/V b3 V b3.5 V2 b4 g: III+6
m8 i6 b1.5 iv b2 V b3 i || b4 i
m9 V6 b2 i b3 iv6 b4 V6/5/iv
Note: C minor is read as iv/iv in D minor here, to capture the parallel with chorale 16 and others, where the melody ends with a natural-minor 7-6-5.  Here, 7 is often harmonized with iv/iv.
