Note: I6/4 resolves with unusual voice leading
m2 I6/4 b2 V b3 I || b4 V4/3/V

Note: big plagal dominant

Note: compare final phrase to chorales 10 and 16.  Long series of (lightly decorated) ascending fifths: D A E e b [C#] F#.  Note the strict sequence that starts the passage, continuing to the A#.  The motions G#-A#-B and B-C#-D should be simultaneous; they are spread across two beats, masked by a voice exchange!
