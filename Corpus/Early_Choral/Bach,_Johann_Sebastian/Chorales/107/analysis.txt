Time Signature: 4/4

Note: descending 8-7-6-5 melody, harmonized with first part of the Pachelbel pattern
m0 b4 Eb: I
m1 V b2 vi b3 iii b4 ii7/IV b4.5 V4/3/IV
Note: plagal dominant cadence
Note: now the 8-7-6-5 is harmonized with the second part of the Pachelbel pattern, a bit of doubly invertible counterpoint

m10 I6 b2 V6/5 b3 I b4 ii b4.5 viio6
m11 I6 b2 V6/V b3 V || b4 I
m12 I b2 vi b3 ii6 b4 ii4/3 b4.5 ii6/5
m13 I6/4 b2 V b3 I || b4 viio6
Note: Measure 14 is a complicated passage with sequential bass and nonsequential upper voices; well worth discussing in detail.
Note: Main reading has b4 as a vi chord with the Eb3 a nonharmonic note leapt-to and away from.  (A kind of "anticipation to the harmony" -- see also the Ab major prelude in WTC I.)  The variant reads the IVmaj7 chord as part of a larger ii7; soprano moves down from root to fifth, tenor is a rare quarter-note neighbor.  If the D were a genuine seventh it would resolve strangely (though this does sometimes happen).
