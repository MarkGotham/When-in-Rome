m0 b4 Bb: I
m1 vi b2 V6/5/IV ||: b3 IV b4 F: V6
m2 i b2 V7 b3 I || b4 I6
m3 IV b2 V b3 IV6 b4 V6
m4 I b2 V7 b3 I || b4 Bb: I6
Note: repeat here has no fermata before it (fix this elsewhere!)
Note: for computer reasons, the first ending is here given as a note
Note: rare IV6-I without passing tone, also unprepared V2
m5 IV6 b2 I b3 V2 b4 I6 b4.5 V6/5/IV
Note: m5a IV b2 I :|| [FIRST ENDING]
m6 IV b2 I b3 V || b4 c: viio6
m7 i b2 ii/o6/5 b2.5 V b3 iv6 b4 V
m8 i || b4 Bb: V2
m9 I6 b2 ii b2.5 viio6 b3 I b4 viio6
Note: the I6 in m10 has no root; could be iii; also reading b2 as IV because tenor leaps away from Bb
m10 I6 b2 IV b3 V || b4 IV6
Note: interesting fauxbourdon ROTO variant, V4/3/IV instead of I6/4, which resolves deceptively to ii6/5
m10var1 iii b2 IV b3 V || b4 IV6
m11 V4/3/IV b2 ii6/5 b3 V2 b4 I6 b4.5 ii6/5
Note: common suspension chain here appears as an anticipation chain
Note: last measure has only 3 beats, time signature change is for the computer
