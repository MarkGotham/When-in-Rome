Time Signature: 4/4
 
Note: chorale opens with a largely half-note harmonic rhythm
m1 D: I b2 I6 b2.5 I b3 IV b4 ii6 b4.5 ii
m2 V7 b1.5 V2 b2 V4/3 b3 I ||
Note: the next phrase is I viio6 I6 in half-notes, reading the A/C# on beat 3 as a double suspension
m3 A: I b2 I6 b2.5 I b3 viio6 b4 viio6/4 b4.5 viio6
m3var1 A: I b2 I6 b2.5 I b3 ii7 b4 viio6/4 b4.5 viio6
Note: reading B4 as an accented neighbor, D5 echappee; alternatively B4 is a decorated quarter-note anticipation
m4 I6 b2 I6/4 b2.5 I6 b2 b3 ii6/5 b3.5 ii7 b4 V
m5 I || b3 D: I b4 I6 b4.5 I
m6 IV b2 ii b3 V6/5 b3.5 iii6 b4 IVmaj6/5 b4.5 V6/5
m7 I || b3 iii b4 V6/5/ii b4.5 V7/ii
m8 ii b2 V6/5 b2.5 V7 b3 I b3.5 I6 b4 ii6/5 b4.5 ii7
m9 V b2 V7 b3 I ||
Note: tonality of the next measure is uncertain.  F# sounds like a modal dominant of b.
Note: reading as a discursive modulation with a leaping nonharmonic tone, because that seems to fit with similar passages elsewhere.
m10 b: i b2 i6 b3 v b4 A: I
m10var1 b: i b2 i6 b3 v b4 A: I b4.5 vi7
m10var2 b: i b2 i6 b3 v b4 v6/5 b4.5 v7 A: vi7
m11 V6/5/V b1.5 V7/V b2 V b3 I ||
Note: discursive-ish modulation, with the first two chords making perfect sense in A, and then the turn to D signaled by IV.
m12 vi b2 IV D: I b3 IVmaj6/5 b3.5 V6/5 b4 I b4.5 vi
m13 ii6/5 b1.5 ii7 b2 V b3 I ||
