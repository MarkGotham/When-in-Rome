Time Signature: 4/4
 
m0 b4 D: V6
Note: melody D has a funny escape tone -- or perhaps an anticipation to the alto's D on beat 3?
m1 I b2 viio6 b3 I6 b4 I
m2 IV || b4 V6/5/V
m3 V b2.5 V2 b3 I6 b4 V6/5
m4 I b2 V b3 I || b4 I6
Note: tenor D is a little funny -- either a neighbor tone in the EQE configuration, or a suspension from the dissonant D in an unaccented I6/4.  Voting for EQE here.
m5 IV b2 ii b3 V7
m5var1 IV b2 ii b3 V7 b3.5 I6/4 b4 V7
m6 I || b4 D: V6
m7 I b2 A: viio6 b3 vi b4 ii6/5
m8 I6/4 b2 V b3 I || b4 D: V
m9 I b3 I6 b4 V7/IV
m10 IV || b4 A: V6/5/V
Note: beat 3 is great from a voice-leading nerd perspective.  One could read a vi4/3 chord with a double suspension.  Another possibility is iii7, which makes F# and A passing notes in the EQE configuration.  (A rare instance of a double EQE!)  Yet a third is Imaj7, combining the first two readings.
m11 V b2.5 V2 b3 iii7 b4 V7
m11var1 V b2.5 V2 b3 vi4/3 b4 V7
m12 I || b4 D: I6
m13 IV b2 I6 b3 ii b: iv b4 viio7
m14 i || b4 D: V6
m15 I b2 IV6 b3 ii6/5 b4 V b4.5 V7
