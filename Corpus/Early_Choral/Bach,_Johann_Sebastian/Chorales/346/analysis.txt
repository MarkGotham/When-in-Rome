Time Signature: 4/4

Note: realization of figured bass #63 in the Riemenschneider edition
m1 e: i b3 viio7 b4 i b4.5 i6
m2 VImaj7 b2 iv6 b3 V ||
Note: the vi6/5 is pretty unusual; you could almost say the E is a quarter-note anticipation
Note: the IV6/4 is also strange!  Bass leaps up from fifth to root and then down a tritone.
m3 G: I b3 vi6/5 b4 IV6/4 b4.5 IV
Note: alto b1.5 has a nice example of an incomplete neighbor in parallel with a more conventional passing tone
m4 V6 b2 V b2.5 V7 b3 I b4 I ||
m5 e: VI b3 V6 b4 i
m6 ii/o6/5 b2 V b2.75 V7 b3 i ||
Note: discursive modulation
m7 i b2 G: I b3 V6 b4 I b4.5 I6
m8 IV6 b2 IVmaj7 b3 V b3.75 V7 b4 I ||
m9 I b2 vi b3 IVmaj7 b4 D: V6 b4.5 V6/5
m10 I || b3 G: I b4 IV6
Note: weird-bass deceptive resolutions, like V6-vi, suggest that the deceptive cadence is a genuine harmonic phenomenon, and also suggest root-functionality is at play
m11 V6 b2.5 iii7 b3 IV6 b3.5 V6/5 b4 I
m12 V || b3 I b4 vi a: v
Note: soprano b2 a quarter-note decoration of the D5-C5 resolution
m13 V7 b2 V b2.5 V6 b3 i b4 G: I6
m14 V b2 e: V6 b2.5 V6/5 b3 i b3.5 i6 b4 iv6 b4.5 i6/4
m15 ii/o6/5 b2 V b2.5 V7 b3 I ||
