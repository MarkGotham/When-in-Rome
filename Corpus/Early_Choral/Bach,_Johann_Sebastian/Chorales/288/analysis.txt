Time Signature: 4/4

Note: modal melody, suggests A mixolydian, very strange chorale, worth a second look
Note: the opening feels like vi-IV6-IV in A, an implication which is in fact realized in the final phrase but only very weak here.
m0 b4 D: iii
m1 V6 b2 I b3 ii6 b4 V2
m2 I6 b1.5 I b2 V b2.5 V7 b3 I ||
Note: weird V-ii6 progression.  Tempting to view this whole phrase as A mixolydian, with I-v6-vi-V6-I, which is standard modality but with a minor dominant (here in major again).  Again, worth another look.
m3 V b2 ii6 b3 A: vi b4 V6 b4.5 V6/5
m4 I b2 V b3 I || b4 D: I
Note: discursive modulation? vi-vi again; A major established only briefly
m5 vi b2 A: vi b3 I6 b4 V
m6 E: V6/5 b1.5 I b2 V b3 I || b4 IV
m7 V2 b2 V4/3 b3 I b3.5 b: IV2 b4 viio6
Note: rapid-fire tonicization of D, A, E each with an applied half-diminished chord
m8 i D: vi b2 IV6 b2.5 vii/o7 b3 I A: IV b3.5 vii/o4/3 b4 I6 b4.5 vii/o7/V
m9 V || b3 vi b4 I6 b4.5 V6/5/IV
m10 IV b3 I ||
