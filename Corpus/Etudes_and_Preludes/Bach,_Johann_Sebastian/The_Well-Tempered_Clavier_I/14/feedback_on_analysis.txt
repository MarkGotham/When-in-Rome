PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


RARE ROMAN NUMERALS =====================

No rare or unconventional Roman Numerals in this analysis.

HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

Total cases: 3

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 9, i6 in c# minor appears on beat 1.5.

Measure 11, i in c# minor appears on beat 1.5.

Measure 24, V in f# minor appears on beat 2.5.


BASS / INVERSION =====================

The inversions look good: the bass note/s implied by the Roman numerals appear at least once in the lowest part during the relevant span.
