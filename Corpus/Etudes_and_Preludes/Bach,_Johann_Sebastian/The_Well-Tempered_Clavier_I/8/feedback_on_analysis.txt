PITCH COVERAGE =====================

Total cases: 1

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.58%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 28, beat 1, viio/v in eb minor, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C', 'Eb'] accounting for successive slices of [['Cb6'], ['A5'], ['Bb5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



RARE ROMAN NUMERALS =====================

No rare or unconventional Roman Numerals in this analysis.

HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.

BASS / INVERSION =====================

Total cases: 1

Overall bass note match: 97.5%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 39, beat 1, viio65 in eb minor, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['Eb3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
