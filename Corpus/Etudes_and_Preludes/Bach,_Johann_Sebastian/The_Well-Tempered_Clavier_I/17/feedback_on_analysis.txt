PITCH COVERAGE =====================

Total cases: 1

I rate the pitch coverage at about 99.53%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 17, beat 1, I6 in Eb major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'Bb', 'Eb'] accounting for successive slices of [['G2', 'Bb4'], ['G2', 'Eb5'], ['F2', 'D5'], ['F2', 'C5'], ['G2', 'Bb4'], ['G2', 'Ab4']].
Match strength estimated at 59.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



RARE ROMAN NUMERALS =====================

No rare or unconventional Roman Numerals in this analysis.

HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.

BASS / INVERSION =====================

The inversions look good: the bass note/s implied by the Roman numerals appear at least once in the lowest part during the relevant span.
