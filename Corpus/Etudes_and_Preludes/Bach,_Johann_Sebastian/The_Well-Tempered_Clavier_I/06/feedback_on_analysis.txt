PITCH COVERAGE =====================

Total cases: 3

I rate the pitch coverage at about 98.75%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 4, V65 in d minor, indicating the pitches ['C#', 'E', 'G', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'E4'], ['D3', 'C#4'], ['D3', 'G4'], ['D3', 'E4'], ['D3', 'C#4'], ['D3', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 48.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 21, beat 4, #iv√∏7 in d minor, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B', 'D', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['G#2', 'F3', 'D4'], ['G#2', 'F3', 'Bb3'], ['G#2', 'F3', 'F4']].
Match strength estimated at 44.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 25, beat 1, viio7/v in d minor, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B', 'D', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [['F#5'], ['Eb5'], ['C5']].
