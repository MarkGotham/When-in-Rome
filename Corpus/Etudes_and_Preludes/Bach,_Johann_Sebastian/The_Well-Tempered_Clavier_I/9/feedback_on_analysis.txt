PITCH COVERAGE =====================

The pitch coverage looks good: all of the chords match the corresponding sections of the score well.


RARE ROMAN NUMERALS =====================

No rare or unconventional Roman Numerals in this analysis.

HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

Total cases: 3

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 8, viio[no3]/V in B major appears on beat 1.67.

Measure 22, viio7/v in E major appears on beat 1.67.

Measure 23, viio4b3 in E major appears on beat 4.67.


BASS / INVERSION =====================

The inversions look good: the bass note/s implied by the Roman numerals appear at least once in the lowest part during the relevant span.
