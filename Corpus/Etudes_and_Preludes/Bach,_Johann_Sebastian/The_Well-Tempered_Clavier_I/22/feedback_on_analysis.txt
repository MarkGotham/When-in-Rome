PITCH COVERAGE =====================

Total cases: 2

I rate the pitch coverage at 99.27%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 8, beat 4, viio[no3] in f minor, indicating the pitches ['Eb', 'Bb'] accounting for successive slices of [['E3', 'Bb4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 21, beat 1, V in bb minor, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['F3', 'C4', 'E4', 'G4', 'Bb4'], ['F3', 'C4', 'F4', 'A4'], ['F3', 'Db4', 'F4', 'G4', 'Bb4']].
Match strength estimated at 55.0%.
How about:
m21 b1.75 viø64#2 for the slice ['F3', 'D-4', 'F4', 'G4', 'B-4']



RARE ROMAN NUMERALS =====================

The following Roman numerals are perfectly clear and the system has no trouble parsing them, though they are somewhat rare so may be worth reviewing:

Measure 8, beat 4: viio[no3] in f minor.

Measure 9, beat 2: VI[no3] in f minor.

Measure 20, beat 1: V[no5] in b- minor.
